One negative about using this app is that there is no room to adjust the customer payment schedule. Sometimes emergencies arise where someone will need to delay a payment, and this company and its app don't seem to understand or care about that. The second negative side to using this app is that all purchases made are not interest-free. Conversely, Klarna does both.",

Cant book a hotel because you click on \"view deal\" and again, nothing. Just keep clicking and nothing. And every store has these issues. So the its 100% the affirm app and is very frustrating.

Items returned and store has issued refund but has to go through affirm afterwards. That dept needs attention. No email in regards what to do. Unable to find contact person. Very poor design and extremely slow response when you do find someone and extremely slow on refunds. I'm done with purchasing through here once and for all. Still waiting on 2 refunds.",

Well, almost 2 years now, and 4 purchases totaling almost $2500. I'm by no means a veteran, but making a purchase, scheduling a payment, making those scheduled payments is a snap! My perspective and my experience have changed; affirm has helped me to establish credit while purchasing the items that I need. However, reaching a rep can be difficult if needed? Nov 2023",
