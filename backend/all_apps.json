            "At this point I can't get passed the screen that's green with a white $ in the middle. Can't click anything. All started after updating. They claim its my device which is a newer device and was just fine until yesterday. I try to access online, but I don't get anywhere. I call and they keep saying the same thing. Update I called to close account, and the gentleman I talked to said it wasn't my phone and sent it higher up. Update again they reached out and are working on it.",
            "Easy to use app to pay or request money and keep track of everything. Easily displays your accumulated balance, which can be easily transferred to your bank account. If there are no or insufficient funds, you simply withdraw them from your connected bank account. What I don't like is that I don't like to see other people's transactions between your connections, which means others can also see mine, so you need to be careful with your transaction descriptions or change your privacy settings",
            "I'm in the US yet this app continuously says \"cash not available in your region\" extremely inconvenient when it happens randomly without rhyme or reasoning. (Added later) I don't wanna go to support literally every time the app doesn't work right, just make an app that works 100% of the time. Venmo doesn't have this problem. Maybe yall could take some notes from them.",
            "Great services, not great customer service. Things I enjoy about the app are the automatic round-up savings, interest-earning savings account, overdraft protection, the \"Borrow\" feature, and ease of sending and receiving money. Unfortunately things I cannot recommend this app for, in particular, is paying for hotels that have security deposits (that are later supposed to come off, but take forever), and the customer service via Chat, which was frankly rude despite my attempts to be courteous.",
            "Best online money app I've ever used. Even though they take a dollar every time you put money on your card through a store or transfer it from your cash app to your bank it's a small price to pay for the very non-restrictive limitations otherwise in play. I absolutely adore the ability to lock and unlock the account at my own will. That is very \"clutch\" at repelling those extra or repeat charges for subscriptions you don't really want to be a part of but sometimes forget to cancel."

Secondly, the website said it couldn't understand my request, so it's not smart enough to connect to google pay. Third, I can't add any of my cards. It keeps saying that that I have insufficient funds(Even though it said I didn't have to pay for anything) or that I need to add a different card, even though my card was VISA.",
            "They suck now. Their security methods are exhausting with all those little pictures to prove you're human. I've been told that they steal your information from your phone when they make you do those puzzles. Also, they changed the app so now I can't find my PayPal Credit balance in the app. I have to go online. And just because my balance went up to $90, it resulted in a 39 point drop on my credit score.",
            "if you actually need the money someone's sending you, you're better off using almost any other platform. PayPal will decide arbitrarily to send payments as an \"e-check\" which just means it's going to take a week to be put into your account for no reason. plus they're constantly trying to get you to sign up for credit cards and such and will bug you multiple times per transaction to do so. thinking about getting cashapp to avoid the wait times and constant popup bombardment",
            "What happened? it was good in the past. Most of the auto fill fields don't work. The lag from my click to display keeps me doubting if it registered me clicking on something. Less than 10% of the home screen is relevant to me. Changing addresses and card information is more difficult than it needs to be. I just use this for casual payments and it's a process anytime I use PayPal, I almost gave up on a $30 purchase today just because of all the friction, it took me almost 5 minutes to pay!"

I've had for almost 6 years and haven't had a problem. easy to dispute any charges and can control everything by app. would highly recommend to anyone. credit builder built my credit 100 points within 6 months.",
            "Qs far as Checking and savings accounts go, I've had a few issues but uexpected after banking 3+ years. But about a year ago I switched jobs and my new direct deposit started going here. Then all of a sudden my Credit Builder Card gets denied they closed my Credit Builder accout for no payment!! I forgot to add my direct deposit to take a portion of $ out which was shown as nonpayment! It's a Damn prepaid credit card, how can you not make a payment on a prepaid card. There NO payments to miss!!",
            "I love Tha different accounts, checking, credit builder and savings. easy to instantly transfer money between them, as much as you want and often as you want for free. nothing builds credit faster. also free boosts, go negative without penalty, you can earn money when your friends n family join with a direct deposit. I'll never use a bank again!!!",
            "They make it easy to move money between accounts and pay others across multiple platforms. If needed they offer free overdraft protection that comes in handy if money is tight. The credit builder card is fantastic to help build or repair your credit rating. They also have great rewards for referrals. I would recommend Chime to anyone.",
            "I've have physical bank buildings in my area to choose from. However, NONE of them were as friendly and helpful as Chime. The option to turn off all transactions is WONDERFUL. I admit when I first started my Chime account, I was skeptical. Due to the fact theres no physical building (in driving distance) if I did have a problem. On the few occasions, I needed to talk to someone a Chime representative was there. Gotta say thank you, Chime, for always having my back. Plus, my credit is going up!"

            "I was somewhat tricked into opening a Venmo credit account. All I wanted to do was pay a friend for a meal. I opened the app and was prompted to enter my address and income. Yes, I probably should have stopped and asked \"why\" but I was tired and thought they just wanted updated information. Turns out I opened a credit account. Support is all offshore and nearly useless. I was able the close the account but minor damage was done to my credit history because of this.",
            "Works fine, but SUPER annoying that I can't change top friends. My top friends are all people that I've venmoed once or twice almost 4 years ago, meanwhile I have to search manually for the friends I pay twice a week every single time. Why can't I edit my top friends? Or at the very least, why doesn't it automatically update to include people that I've paid in the last month 😭 super annoying, it's making me consider using a different app",
            "Payments have been fine, but I've never been able to pay anyone with my venmo balance or do an automatic transfer. I can only do a bank transfer or pay from my bank. I sent in documents for identity verification specifically for these reasons, but it's been at least half a year or more since I sent them in and nothing. Supposed to be 2-3 days for a response....yeah, okay. I've sent in several submissions to customer service asking about it and no response whatsoever. Customer service is a joke.",
            "For sending money to friends, great app. But lots of problems all the time with using the debit card attached to my account as well as funding the account. Sometimes it just won't work, no matter what. And customer service isn't open a lot of the time. When they are they make it hard as hell to reach a live person, then when you finally can all they say is sorry, they can't tell me why it's not working at this time and try again later. No solutions. So other than sending money it sucks.",
            "Venmo apparently is owned or a part of PayPal. However, it does not function anywhere near as well as PayPal. With PayPal, it's easy to get a hold of support in the event you have a problem via chat. You can't do that with venmo, you have to call them and navigate their phone assistant and hopefully if you hit the right number you will get a hold of a human. I hate venmo."

            "This App is completely unusable. Once you get to the create password section, it won't allow me to type in a password. My keyboard completely disappears and it looks like it's glitching out. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times, annnnd restarted my phone. Still won't work. I tried doing the \"copy and paste trick\" that I read on another review but no luck. I'm beyond frustrated!",
            "It's hit or miss with this app. I get error messages when trying to send people money, can't find them even though they're in my contacts, and they can't find me. I just had to send requests to friends for payments they were trying to send me.....we'll see if that works. Sometimes, the app works for me ,sometimes, it doesn't. Frustrating!",
            "I can anymore with zelle, why does it work only on and off. I love zelle, but if I don't use it on a regular basis, it doesn't function for whatever reason. I just checked to see if there was a new update that I needed, but no doesnt show one. It has me logged out, but I can click the sign in button. Everytine it seems like I will have to Uninstaller and re install, which makes you lose all previous zelle history and contacts. Zelle you need to get it together",
            "At first I experienced the password issue like everyone else. I solved that issue by typing my password and then copying to the clipboard. I then went back to the zelle app and would hold down on the word password. Slide your finger up just a little bit and the option to paste from clipboard stays available and you can enter your password, thus completing setup.",
            "Less than 1 star. The app won't scan my debit card. It moves the cursor to the beginning after typing first character in many of the fields. It won't keep the keyboard up while trying to enter a password and now is throwing errors when trying to log back in. How does anyone trust this app? Complete garbage!!!"

            "This app has lots of bugs. I was almost finished and tried to file multi states and it populated earned interest into the wrong state and you can't edit it. Lots of \"oops, can't find...\" when you click for more info. So I requested a call back. It took only a few minutes to get a call. But the support person couldn't help and he just ghosted me. I kept asking \"are you there?\" No answer. I've used turbo tax for over 10 years but now I won't use them again.",
            "Originally chose the package that was reduced to free. Then it forced me to upgrade to the expensive package because of some stupid credit that I dont think I even had. Ended up costing way more than I could afford for nothing. It's become hard to navigate when I need to add something; but when I finally found it I wasn't allowed to add or edit anything!!! The way they charge $$$ for nonsense makes it feel more like a scam than help. GO TO A LOCAL PERSON THAT DOES TAXES IT WILL BE CHEAPER!",
            "I apologize, I'm just frustrated. I don't want to influence anyone either way, I was speaking for my experience only and I have used and will continue to use TurboTax I just don't care for the app. I despise this app. I have to go through the whole verification process every time I try to open the app and have to change password each time. I even uninstalled and tried again with same results. This is so stupid...🤯",
            "It was dumb to think an app could do this complex job. I paid and had my files rejected 3 times through TurboTax. I got the exact same forms, paid someone else to file them for me and they went through immediately. Now TurboTax doesn't want to give me a refund for an unused service. Their customer service people are so bad, the hate for their job oozes through the call. I had to let the person know other non customer service jobs exist. Just an awful experience. Unprofessional, and fraudulent.",
            "Was forced to upgrade from free in order to claim a tax \"credit\". The \"upgrade\" costs $39... But that only covers federal... You have to upgrade your state taxes, too, even though it's a federal credit and doesn't effect state taxes. On top of that, they charge a $4 fee anytime you use a credit card, so now I'm down about $90... And the tax \"credit\" that I received for this ridiculous upsell? Exactly $0.... Intuit gets worse every year. I will never recommend any of their software."

            "Slow. For an App that is sponsored on the big stage of UFC, I expected a way more fluid user experience. The UI is confusing and average at best. Some crypto needs you to buy in specific increments and the app doesn't automatically do that for you, you have to manually adjust. Unacceptable in my opinion. I expected more from this app. In app customer service was responsive so that's good. Deposits worked well. Selling is a little easier than buying. 3/5 ⭐.",
            "Overall misleading marketing practices. I mostly have been trying to use the visa card, but it hardly works anywhere, and there's all these claims about getting cash back but it's at very specific locations and not entire chains. Any money on the card is basically locked up with no way to withdraw it. The quests are expensive. Overall not a beginner friendly app and misleading in many ways. There are much better options available",
            "Log in experience is just downright horrible! What kind of developers decided to let a ads popup cover the bottom half of the number options for entering PIN? I had to verify via email, verify via SMS, then the app asked for PIN which I wasn't able to provide because the popup covered the numbers I needed to enter, and then it locked me out because I failed to log in 3 times! Unbelievable!",
            "High spread, I truly hate the delay in the total asset amount. I do not know why my \"option\" trades decrease in value by a crazy amount while the price is way over my prediction and increasing. I think this app has a lot of potential, but it definitely needs work still. Would like to see better charts as well it's currently very limited. I'll give it 3 stars for now. Hopefully, changes are made.",
            "Prices don't sync right among other problems. But it has the most crypto though. If issues would be fixed then I'd rate 5 stars.\"Update\"still same problems but worse I've lost $5k+ because of these issues I bought a coin at .011 it went up to .0139+ and It sold for almost the same price I bought it at. made $20 when I should have made $500. currently it's not worth buying/selling a coin unless it 2x's or more because you won't get anything out of it. Tried talking support, no help won't respond."

            "I used to use Google Pay all the time and now with the new setup, it to difficult to turn off the NFC. Once you turn it on from the Wallet you have to go like 3 steps deep into the settings menu to turn it off. Gone are the days that you can easily turn it on and off from the pull down menu at the top of in the app. Until this is changed I will go back to using credit cards physically.",
            "It's terrible compared to Google Pay. Doesn't allow for locking the app (apart from the device screen lock). Send/request options gone, as well as tracking. This seems to be a complete jump backward. I'll be uninstalling and continuing to use Google Pay until it goes away in June. If Google Wallet hasn't improved by then, it'll probably be time to switch to Samsung Pay.",
            "Used it to pay for a $35 tank of gas and it showed a transaction amount of over $170. Had to pull up my card details to make sure it didn't over charge. (It didn't). This glitch combined with the lack of security settings (a review and confirmation screen, option to re-enter pin or fingerprint to confirm) these are basic security settings. Google, once a giant has fallen so far.",
            "Still can't add custom Loyalty cards easily in the GOOGLE WALLET app. The workflow is to \"take a picture\" and use the image to create the custom Loyalty card. Can't comment on the pay portion. I haven't used it in years. It never \"just worked\" so I gave up and use the card. At one point, the payment wouldn't work with the Android setting \"Require device unlock for NFC\". No idea if that ever got fixed. Probably not.",
            "Google Wallet is great when it works. But, several times, for no apparent reason, it has stopped working. I use it for my public transit card and have been left numerous times with no way to pay with plenty of money on the card. It is very frustrating and embarrassing. Today, I checked every setting and checked for updates. Everything is set correctly, but Wallet still won't work."

Others reported the same problem. Please fix the damn app. I'm seriously thinking of closing the credit card account. It's just too inconvenient to log on from browser.",

Every. Single. Time. I've tried restarting it. Restarting my phone, switching between wifi and data. Nothing works it just stays on that screen the whole time.",

Ive restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and still nothing. Expect us to pay our card bills on time but can't even get the app to load anymore. Thanks for breaking and ruining the app!",

Edit: It's been awhile, I've added 2 more cards, and have gotten used to the app, therefore have increased my rating by 2 stars. nothing I would change. out of all my credit card/ banking apps,this Capital One is 100% the best. So easy to use and absolutely love the home page upon opening I can see my cards and balances very clearly! Good job, Capital One!",
            "I have always found this app really useful but since the last update I can barely open it. I live in a place with slower internet and it could be that the be version is so data heavy I can't use it here, but it is just stuck on the opening page with the logo or just the circle and never opens. But it always worked perfectly before. It seems like other people are also having this issue in the land of good internet. Hoping it can be fixed soon!!"

            "I've used this app since 2017. I love the free app. the ability to check your scores and little words of encouragement that pop up when you make progress, and emails you get to improve, or look for a new card. I have had several loans thru this app giving recommendations and really love it! I wasn't a fan of the karma drive at first, but it did give me a great score on insurance! I received their Instant Karma feature when it first came out, which was awesome, but it's no longer available.",
            "Similar to others, too many ads. it's clear that the driving purpose of this app is to get you to buy other products. I can easily find information about my credit score and get a loan, but finding information about my budget is gone. The convenience from mint that made it so helpful in budgeting, such as categories, setting goals, etc, are gone. Too bad because I used it for years. Deleting the app and my account and moving on.",
            "One massive ad masquerading as an app. Mint had it's fair share of ads as well, but at least it was useful. Now, I no longer have my home screen widget that I had before, credit cards aren't linking correctly, I can't hide transactions and sub accounts from my net worth calculations, and I get way more spam then I did before. Way to screw up everything you touch, Intuit. All good in search of the all mighty dollar, I guess.",
            "I was forced to switch to this from mint. I can't find where I can view my individual transactions (don't think it exists) and it's more ads than information. I get needing some ads to keep the app free to me, but I feel like I'm giving away personal information for companies to better target me and to get hardly anything in return. The one positive I can see is that I now see two credit scores instead of one. Not that helpful. Very disappointed.",
            "I used to love this app, but it changed way too much. I don't know the score system they used to use because they no longer advertise it, so I assume they changed over to FICO scoring, which takes longer to update. I also noticed that their name changed to Intuit Credit Karma. It's too bad they ruined the app. Love this app! It lets me keep track of my credit score, and It gives me approval odds on credit cards and personal loans recommendations."

            "The new redesign is ok. It takes a few too many taps to get from the front page to being able to view debit/savings and actually do the things the app was built to do. I hate it when big UI updates are rolled out unexpectedly and it's especially jarring when it's something as personal and vital as banking. It makes me fear that policy changes will also be made very suddenly.",
            "Wasn't going to review but the app has become terrible. Stays stuck on loading upon opening the app. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled a couple of times but doesn't fix. All of this started since the latest update. Nothing more disappointing than not being able to check your checking and savings. Not to mention being scammed recently and the dispute being closed within a day after an unauthorized withdrawal and obviously was not in my favor. No number to call, only a \"chat\". Going back to a bank.",
            "Dont be mislead, there is no 'instant transfer' option. Its 1 to 3 business days. Unless you want to withdraw cash but it seems more complicated than casting a spell in Wiccan. L Update: well, the transfers aren't instant, but overnight is pretty close enough. And it was my employer w the shady wording. The app works really well and gives you alot of saving options. User interface might have gotten worse since the last update, but thats pretty much every popular app these days. Would recommend!",
            "My hope is one day they get as good as simple was before they closed. I'm a legacy user so I have a better features than people who are brand new to the app which I appreciate being grandfathered in but I feel everyone should have access to the same features and perks I have. They're slowly bringing back certain features that they removed after the merger but it's getting back to where it was slowly. App can be glitchy at times. Like right now it's not letting me see any of my balance.",
            "Edit. I got a review statement in my email and all it does is send me here to the Google Play store. I love this app, better than Bluebird by American Express. This app has a lot of great features. Not all things are intuitive but I eventually find what I am looking for. Love the 3% in my savings pockets. I haven't yet had an issue. Highly recommend. I'm on an old Android A02s."

            "The app often says I used my phone while driving when my phone is in my purse on my passenger seat for the whole ride. I wish they would improve that or stop tracking phone use. I'm tired of seeing that I used my phone 6 times when I didn't even look at it, much less touch it. Very frustrated. I think I might have 5 stars if the app worked right.",
            "The Snapshot feature is a safety issue. It incentivizes breaking less, and now I second guess myself when I do require hard braking to avoid collisions. It also doesn't give you a chance to justify the false reports it gives, like it saying the driver used their phone if the passenger actually used their phone or if hard braking was used in the course of defensive driving to avoid a collision. It also doesn't let you go back very far in its history to change when you're a passenger.",
            "The App should not record any \"phone use\" while someone is parked and stationary! Where's the logic in that? What's the point then in pulling over and STOPPING to use the phone if you're STILL going to be penalized? Might as well just use your phone while you're driving then. Instead of being rewarded for good driving habits the App makes sure you're penalized. Worst. App. Ever.",
            "Constant battery drain. I have to force close it all the time, but then snapshot stops tracking. For example today, the dumb app ran for 9 hours straight and used 13% total battery. I drove for 30 minutes in total today. Such a joke. EDIT: still an issue. Sitting completely idle on the phone without any driving can use up to 8% in a day.",
            "They cant/won't help you on the phone or in chat. If they can help, it's going to cost you. I even tried to stop automatic payments for one month, and they were going to charge me like 40 bucks total, and they said it may or may not stop my automatic payments anyways....if you are new to progressive, go with another company.

            "Mostly intuitive banking/credit card app. Easy to navigate. I absolutely HATE that they won't add in a running balance by transaction. Literally would be a 5* app if they added it in. Typical bank. Credit journey could be more informative; my number regularly fluctuates by 20-30 points but the explanations are always the same, but having the info on hand is good. Offers are ok. Haven't used the travel/points redemption area of the app yet.",
            "Constantly crashes. Trying to make a payment is extremely frustrating. I can log in, get to the payment screen then the screen disappears. I then have to re-log in and try again and again and again. Absolutely HATE this app. Needs a LOT of work. Can't wait to pay this card off so I can cancel it and never have to deal with this garbage app again .",
            "I do love the apps features, but it runs terribly slow and constantly crashes or freezes my phone during the login process. my phone can handle all the games I install, even really resource heavy ones so I am not sure why it's struggling to load so much but it's been this way the whole time I've had it, it's been years. I still love the features and how easy it makes things when it works but it's always a gamble if I'll even be able to log in without my phone freezing.",
            "Want random, normal purchases to be flagged as fraudulent?? Download the Chase App! Hoping to miss out on hard-to-get releases because of dogshit fraud detection?? Chase Bank will mess that up for you too! Just check Google and you'll see that this has been an ongoing problem for Chase customers for 5+ years. Seems no one at Chase is smart enough to fix it! The best solution is closing your accounts - which I highly recommend.",
            "Seriously regretting getting chase for the rewards points. The booking site is completely archaic. Very difficult to look through hotels, and absolutely no options to put in how much you would like to spend either above your points or if you would like to view hotels only with in your point range. The map refreshes anytime you move it so that you lose track of what it was you were looking at. And it list hotels aren't even available. Over all super frustrating."

            "For an app that wants to help you save money, it can do that for a VERY expensive price. I signed up through a referral link from a creator to get a week free trial, and after the week is up I got charged the annual price of the \"monthly subscription\" that you chose to pay. Good thing I lowered it from $10 a month default to $4 because I would've been out $120 immediately which not everyone can afford. Would not recommend this app until they charge you monthly like expected. I feel lied to.",
            "Does not let me cancel some subscriptions I'd like to cancel. The option just simply isn't there. Apparently I'm paying for Netflix twice somehow and it's listed as A2A, but when I click the 3 dots on it, there is no option to cancel the subscription. And the chat for customer service is a joke. Can't actually chat for help. You can only select from a list of options.",
            "Good money management and budgeting app. Love being able to see all my balances in one place and track recurring bills, however, could be better with biller connections for real due dates and amounts instead of projections based on past transactions, like Mint and Prism used to have. I think that Intuit is a big enough company to make this happen if a smaller app like prism could do it. Rocket has better monetization than mint or prism did and that feature would make me want to pay for premium.",
            "As a retiree, I found Rocket Money helpful and it provides much understanding of my financial status. Everything I need to monitor is at my finger tips. I am kept informed of all activities prior to the transaction occurring. Easy transition between transactions and net worth. I find it easy to use and educational. I love it! ❤️👍",
            "It is super easy to use and I started saving money right from the start. I was able to open up a savings account and have what I save transfer in there . I used to just look at my statement online, never really questioning everything. Rocket money has me looking at my account and my transactions without all the stress and confusion. Knowing my money better helps me to save my money better. I really do love it!"

            "The BoA app is really user friendly. There's a few things that are a little hard to find but after some searching, you can find your way. That's layout discrepancies, not functional. I find it helpful and easy to deposit checks too. And, if there's funny activity, it's laid out well to get you on track and secure. Security is not an issue as you are alerted if they find anything suspicious starting. Really is a friendly and useful app.",
            "Taking it down a star or two as the app seems to digress with each update. Notable degradations include worse check-deposit imaging/reliability and deteriorated navigation/site architecture making it more difficult to find and execute tasks like Start ATM withdrawal. It has been a great app up until recently. No real technical issues or crashes.",
            "Normally I would rate this one of five. But today I find that on my tablet and my phone, both android, I have wasted time to find out that I can't just easily look at the check images anymore. They are supposedly now in my gallery, and I checked my Google photos, but they're not there. Tried to edit the description of one check. It would not save. Strange note about a missing token for that transaction. Why did you change something that was working just fine before?",
            "Used to be better. I only had to select a single option to pay off a credit card in the statements page from my checking account. They now make you jump through an ever more increasing number of hoops to do it. You now have to go to Pay & Transfer > Pay Bills > Add Payee > Add a Company, and then put in the credit account number and full amount to pay (you'll have to remember from memory or else it erases). This can eventually lead to some people being late in their credit card payments.",
            "The \"Mark As Paid“ button on Bill Pay doesn't work well. It's too close to the \"Pay\" button so unless you have a stylus, which I don't it it keeps wanting to default to Pay button and going that route. I have a very hard getting it to mark as paid. Existing problem for years. This section needs to be reworked. Hoping the dev team sees this!"

            "If I could rate 10 stars I would. I can't say enough good things about Cash App! I use it for all my banking needs. I get paid 3 days early, I save money with roundups, my ATM fees are reimbursed and now I have $50 free overdraft protection! Love this app more than PayPal or Venmo. So easy to send and receive $. No waiting for verification or anything. And almost everyone is on cash app. Super easy to look people up whether or not they are on your contact list",
            "To view your card info you have to open up chrome and go to autofill. If you want to adjust payment settings you need to go the Google app instead. But if you want to tap-to-pay you use google wallet, but if you want to view your transactions you have to use this pointless app. Google took the concept of uncomplicated, convenient, and all in one place, and said \"let's do the polar opposite!\" Half of google searches are just people troubleshooting stupid issues that Google itself created",
            "I've been using it for a while. Really convenient not needing to dig for my wallet everytime. My only wish is that there was some way to get digital receipts when you pay, and they appear in the wallet/pay app. Pretty sure the checkout retail needs to update in order to achieve this, but you'd think saving paper receipts would be good motivation. Still... It's a great app.",
            "Overall, this is a really good app. Especially since the last update that requires users to unlock to use Google Pay. I wish they made access to the wallet a little easier. Currently, pay and insights are on a menu at the bottom but to access wallet you have to go to the menu at the top right, then open wallet. Wallet really needs to be at the bottom where Pay and Insights are located.",
            "Definitely a nice feature if you forget your wallet,purse,debit card,etc., and absolutely have to have gas or something important! Only thing I really wish you could add as a feature would be that it would show you the balance/amount able to spend on each of the attached card accounts. Just a thought, idk if that's something you could even implement into the app, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who would benefit from a feature like that."

            "EDIT : I was able to cash out and it processed pretty fast. I was surprised. I'm $4 away from the cash out minimum, and my check list keeps glitching. I past the requirement on one game, but it didn't check it off. And I downloaded a new game and passed the requirement and haven't gotten it. Plus there is no way to let the app know when you have a problem with an offer. UPDATE I am at the cash out point, but it want me to do a facial recognition and it wont accept it or somthing.",
            "The variety of available games is better than most other play to earn services. I haven't hit the minimum payout yet, which I believe is a little high (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5), but I have heard of others cashing out. You just have to make sure you read the instructions for each game, some have different requirements. For some you have to finish all the goals, others you don't. Some have different limits on how long you have to finish quests. Overall I'm happy with it.",
            "Played the Monopoly all the way, it stopped tracking it partway through, tried to cash out, won't cash out, tried township, began tracking it but then stopped. The whole thing is a waste of time and a scam. They just want information, your information, so they can sell it. You get no compensation for anything. And all the games want you to do is purchase, purchase, purchase. If you're evaluating things you shouldn't need to purchase. I give it a zero if that was an option",
            "I do love the concept of this app, is better (so far) than any of the other earth money apps I've tried. The goals for each game are realistic, and achievable. I would like checking my progress on the games to simpler, however. Other than that I'd recommend it to friend and family. I would've given four our five stars, but haven't completed all of my goals yet\\cashed out yet. But that's because I've only been using the app for a few weeks now.",
            "I didn't play because after install and email sign up, it's pretty clear that games within app require tracking install...not worth any pay out for me personally . Also if forgetting to click \"agree to terms\" the prompt text refers to the terms & conditions as \"hint\". I'll update this review if I begin to receive spam email. Many of these types of apps just seem to be predator apps on folks needing groceries or rent funds."

            "so many hidden fees despite my account meets criteria. FED should close this pos bank down. I'm closing my account after wasting years with this pos bank. It is really hard to find your credit card history transaction and such. I hate this app and bank. So many clicks to see all your \"deposits\" in an account. Need to move the \"filter\" option to each account tab once selected for easy access. Unable to log one the first time, always take 2-3 times to log on.",
            "I like to pay down my CC statement balance a couple chunks at a time, to keep my balance low and not impact my credit score. I really don't like how this app doesn't show the remaining statement balance, they just show the last statement balance. Makes it more complicated to figure out what the remaining statement balance is. The Amex app makes this super easy. It's a simple formula, please just add it to the app as a visual aid and a selectable payment option.",
            "Horrible. Used to work fine for years yet lately for months now, wow, took many attempts to finally got in, always showed all kind of error message, recently said something like lets verify you in different way, really bad. I try to avoid using the app but I have to when depositing checks and it is sp frustrated. It is a big bank so we would expect good technologies but not so much at all.",
            "For the last five or six months this app has become extremely difficult with the login process. EVERYTIME I log on it does the same thing. I go through the ENTIRE logon process only for it to make me start all over once I reach the six digit code that is texts my phone. Today it took me six tries before I could get to the home menu. Extremely frustrating to have to go through this EACH damn time. Fix it!",
            "Now, it's October and the latest \"features\" introduced include not being able to transfer funds between accounts, view notifications, or pay bills. Last month, the new feature was an inability to take a photo of a check when using the online deposit feature. Wow! Reverse improvements. Here's an idea: howabout working harder on functionality. Maybe?"

            "Wish I could give this app a 4.5 rating, it's nearly perfect. Any issues that come up are resolved very quickly by their staff. Sending money is very reliable as long as the receiving party doesn't have any issues on their end My only complaint with the app, is it no longer shows how much money I can send before running into the limits. Before it would show daily, monthly and 180 days in the profile section, but now that feature is completely missing. Please bring it back, very useful.",
            "I am a long time user of Remitly. I am very happy with this service, but the newest version of the App is annoying. When you are done using the App, you can't shut it off easily. I swipe up, which brings up options on every other App on my phone, except Remitly. I have to swipe down, and bring up my phone's settings options, then go to my home screen from there. This needs to be corrected, like yesterday. Hijacking People's web browser is not a path to satisfied users.",
            "I use Remitly often, and I appreciate the quick manner in which they send the money. I also like that their quotes to transfer are much larger than other apps. Recently, they have also added pix which allows me to send money faster to other people I couldn't reach before. I had an issue and was able to solve the problem with 1 phone call. Highly recommend this app.",
            "Remitly was my to go app to send money, but lately, I am unhappy with the latest update. Although they changed the sending free from $3.99 to $1.99, the exchange rate is now very low compared to other apps/ places. I am honestly looking for another app to use instead of Remitly. Also, this app used to have the option to send money instantly, but now that option is no longer available.",
            "I really liked remitly at first. It was easy to use and reasonable sending fee. The recipient received transfers within minutes in their bank account, but recently there has been problems and I'm needing to contact customer service. I paid the fee, but the transfer doesn't go through right away and the status is \"In Progress\". So what is the point of paying $3.99 for express when it's not express?! It's very inconvenient. I need to look for a new app to send money."

            "Not worth having anymore. Was really great to have when u first downloaded it a few years ago. Now it takes forever to load and has locked me out. When you call to reset your account, you get the run around. 03/01/2024 update: The gas since improved drastically. The presentation is simple but functional. An the added features expand how the app can be used. Less glitches",
            "This app is so much more than just an EBT card balance. It has so much more, and it's so easy to use. I'm so glad I downloaded it!! Edit 3-8-2024 I got a new EBT card due to unseen issues and I can't load it in the app. And absolutely no one will help me fix the issue!!! I have written to absolutely everyone who could possibly help me with fixing this issue and no body has or will. New rating is **",
            "Great app with getting information for resources. Sometimes, the app won't connect, but it rarely happens. I had to get a replacement card, and it was easy to remove the old and add the new. However, I did like the old version more because it showed me when my deposit came in and how much.",
            "This app was a wonderful utility at first. But lately, it has been extremely slow to load. And once you do get it to load, it more often than not says that it is unable to connect to your record. BUT NOW, when it loads it says, \"APP COULDN'T LOAD\" and some extremely amateurish link displaying SEND INFO. You guys are making me afraid to use your app with all the hacking going on. PLEASE FIX THIS AND RESTORE OUR CONFIDENCE IN USING THIS APP!!",
            "Have loved using this app. Super convenient to find out updates and new things going on. This month however i haven't been able to open it successfully, keeps repeating that its unable to load at this time. I uninstalled today and reloading. Was able to open but it is still running very slow."

            "It's a pretty good platform game and has a lot to offer for free. It has really everything for all ages of people and brings a lot of ideas to the table. However, even though this is the simpler version of Roblox, there's a lot less to experience. Like how mobile players have a limited customization variation for the avatar editor, or less buttons to work with, bad screen crunch and not being able to edit and make games entirely. But if you are able to look past these issues, it's great.",
            "Amazing. It has zero ads, a gazzilion games, and just awesome! So many customization options, and even free items if your cheap. Only complaint I could possibly have is it only works well if you have internet. It works without it, but is super laggy and long loads. But that was expected. Awesome one-stop shop for games! ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!!!!",
            "Great game. It's fun, but there are so many lags. I join a game, and I immediately get disconnected. It takes me about 7 attempts or more to get into the game I want to play, and it takes numerous attempts to even stay connected and I know it is not my internet because I have a full connection. Second, when an item becomes unavailable and you can't wear it, roblox sends a message to your inbox to redeem lost credit, but when I got one, my robux never came back to me, and it's been over 2 months.",
            "One app with a wide variety of games to choose from, has no lag or issues. If you have a kid, definitely recommend it if he/she is above the age of 9. ALSO! 1 small bug I've noticed recently that has been happening is that people's screens are freezing/can't be moved, don't worry, I found a solution! Click the Roblox icon on the top left of your screen (when in a game) and then exit out of the menu and now your screen can move! (if your camera doesn't move at all)",
            "Great app, but there's some issues I'd like to discuss: All hats were, for some reason, just changed to a minimum price of 65 robux? That's almost a dollar per cheapest hat accessory. When looking at Roblox Catalog/Marketplace on mobile, there's no filter for classic clothing. This causes the search results to come up with all 3D models, even when I type in the exact title of a classic shirt. I'm happy with the games, just wanted to bring attention to these issues."

            "It's well designed but it's just another pointless time waster. I was hoping there'd be some sort of strategy like buying properties to compete against other people but it's just completely random. You roll the dice over and over again and get seemingly random quantities of money and then you tap on properties to upgrade them... And that's it. That's the game. That and pop-ups trying to get you to buy more turns and money so you can do more pointless dice rolling and property \"upgrading.\"",
            "It starts off fun. I loved being able to collect and trade stickers to complete the albums. Trading is one of the funnest parts, until you get stuck on needing gold cards that cant be trading unless they do a gold blitz, which they dont always do. It quickly became apparent the game is rigged, nothing is random. Can't stand games that take no skill, then they intentionally make obstacles in order to have to pay them! Poor game design requiring you to pay to win! I think I am done!",
            "Monopoly Go is getting stale, it needs a larger variety of mini games. The same 2 mini games for almost a year is criminal. Cash grab as a timed event? Wth? That is not worth it, it should be a mini game for the railroad. Don't waste your time on this game if you expect something new and refreshing. It's the same thing over and over again. No new major changes.",
            "It was fun in the beginning. The farther you get in the game the more it takes to finish a board. No matter how much it costs to finish a round you only get 50 dice in return. Stickers are more difficult to get and it costs too many rolls to get anything on the top rewards. Partner events are harder to get points for as well. I'm very close to giving up on this game altogether.",
            "Been playing this game about a year. They fixed the trading so that you can trade in game which is great. The only thing is the likelihood of landing on special tiles is so low. I understand it's a free game and they bank on people spending money because let's face it this is a gambling addiction crutch. But come on.. I have lost so many events and being so close and getting nothing. It's frustrating, yet addicting."

            "The game is fine so far. A very non intrusive tutorial pointing you in the right direction and nice art. So far no real gameplay which is a bummer. Personally, I would like to see a mode where you have to manually control your units to choose their attacks, for example hard difficulty raids. The free draws are actually in the game, although not to the extent you may want. You get x10 summons free per day, which is better than any other game I've seen offering those \"10,000 draws\" which is a lie.",
            "I've been waiting for this game to leave beta for a while, and saw an ad for it about a week before it launched. The art style had changed for the better by a lot, but I could still recognize its soul as being the same game, even with its name being different. 10/10 great unit collector, beautiful art, the premise isn't anything groundbreaking, but its executed well, and I like the story so far",
            "So far, the game is great! The colors and art are nice to look at, especially the designs of the characters.. The story progression is decent and even though this game has a lot of microtransactions, they don't shove it in your face like other games! (Yay) only thing about it is that the story is kinda generic but that's just me lol great game",
            "3d AFK arena clone with less features and even more monetization options for your own enjoyment. At least there aren't any adds but plenty of popup packages that randomly show up and conveniently have the buy button where the 'accept rewards' button is on the activity they are on. A lot of micromanaging too instead of a pure idle game. Disappointed as I was looking forward to this games theme.",
            "Enjoy it very much. It's easy and not too hard . Monster designs r cute, cool, or all the above. I don't like the Gacha system much, but at least it's not too bad to where I can't get good monsters🙂 I will also add that hopefully in future updates the monsters can evolve into different forms when they reach a certain level. Would love to see wat type of designs u guys could come up with if u guys wanted to do that🤩"

            "This game had no things it just. It was kind of straight to the point. There was something covering my view of the character. It was really bad. It was trying to saw me stuff and it was just a really bad game. It didn't even have any interactive stuff. It was just left or right, but the alphabet's remained cute and it was like 2D, but not 2. The the elevations were really bad. It's just a bad game overall. Never act alive for Eddie Wong.It was just a little weird and I'm not inappropriate.....",
            "This game is as advertised, but it has advertisements very frequently. I spent probably 70% - 80% of the time watching ads and about 7% of the time clicking the arrow down on ads in this game. You can not play it offline as it will not let you. Love the artwork, but it's not worth the plethora of ads.",
            "So it's a good game but the only problem is THE ADDS COME UP LATERALY EVER 2-4 SECONDS.It could be just little pop ups or full on adds and even if you say no to an offer it plays them,so I would recommend just watching the add.Other that that thought it's a good game and I like the music, regardless of what other people say.",
            "The game itself seems fun, however it's incredibly difficult to actually play when the ads on the bottom of the screen continually pop up to cover half of the screen. Not like a regular pop up, but worse. In addition to actual pop up ads. \"Game\" is 85% ads. Deleting immediately.",
            "Installed game, launched game, loading bar filled and completed, you'd think that means gameplay well you'd be wrong I got an ad immediately after the game loaded didn't even get to try the game before I got an ad. Tried to play offline to avoid ads since most games allow that. But this one for some reason doesn't. Says some things unavailable offline please check connection. So forced to have ads in this malware disguised as a \"game\"."

            "The game and idea of it is fun and great but there is too many problems. I even purchased a small beginner's pack to start off 20 level and to remove ads. Still hard to play and beat any levels. There's a bad error now that U can't even use the magnet. If U run into the magnet it's supposed to automatically scoop up anything within a certain radius of U but since a about a week ago it doesn't even work and actually now glitches to where U can't pick ANYTHING up with the magnet. Disappointing!",
            "Multiple problems, 1. There are so many ads after you win or die. 2. It's so hard to win because somehow people are reaching lvl 100 in 10 to 15 seconds and you barely can eat others. 3. When you get to the next bos level, there is less lvl ball things than there is in the 1st boss level. 4. It's so hard to get higher than the bosses level. It's a very fun game tho. 3/10",

If you're defeated it asks if you want to watch an ad for a multiplier of the points for that play, even if you click no thanks it forces you to watch an ad anyway. Why bother asking?? Take the amount of ads down a notch or two, and I will love to reinstall and update my rating.",
            "I really like this game there are lots of ads but you can get out of them easily just close the app and re open it but don't shut out the app just click out and back on and the ads are gone it takes less then 5 seconds to do that the only reason I am giving it four stars is because it does get annoying sometimes I would give it three/3 stars it really needs to update but I have only been playing it for a day and overall it's fun I am on like level 5 or 6 so far so yeah it's fun overall!",
            "Too many ads, considering it stops MID play to watch the same ad from the lady 40 times. The upgrades are terrible, buy one and you have to watch an ad, and when you do watch it, it doesn't upgrade. The bosses are too difficult and there's not enough time to play a single round. I always get the same exact Highscore of 1140, and never does it get higher!"

            "It's a fun game & I'm enjoying the challenges of play. I level completed both the Bronze and Silver Levels in only 3 days, but I'm not getting bumped up to the gold level to play. Why not? This game also has a lot of ADs (up to 1 minute long) which I paid to have removed, yet I'm still seeing ads. UGH! But if I'm not going to be bumped up to play further levels, I want my ADs money back since I'll no longer be playing this game...",
            "The ads ARE annoying, but for most of them, you can skip through if you catch the forward tab on the upper left first. In terms of gameplay, it was cool for a while, but I kept wondering why i was trying to win the tournaments. It's for coins, helicopters or hints that I don't need. Races are impossible to win if you don't go ad free. There needs to be...more to the game, something to retain interest, to work towards. It's a good pick up game when you're bored, but otherwise...eh 🤷",
            "Just started playing because it looked good to keep my brain active.. it's exactly that! Love it so far!! At Level 26 I noticed at the top, \"Moves: 4\" OMGosh, got nervous and started messing up, but on track; don't think about it! Ads per most games, but you can \"X\" out of them. Love that if you crash, you don't have to start over completely (so far). I'll see how it goes and maybe update later. Keeps your brain active, not just another \"pass the time\" game. So far, absolutely recommend!",
            "This game is really challenging and you know a good time passer but the ads are insane after you get to level seven or eight they play an ad after every single level. I get the concept of playing ads to get boosters that's great that's a choice. having to watch a 30-second ad after every two to three minute game is absolutely insane. I understand that's how they make it free play but they need to make the ads optional. I will be deleting. The ads are CRAZY an a deterrent from enjoymemt.",
            "The problem with ALL these games. More time is spent viewing ads than playing the game!! I've been hit with so many ads/pop-ups and redirects I've actually lost where my game was! You have to be in the right headspace for these games cuz the inundation of the ads will make you want to drop kick your computer catapult your laptop and throw your droid at the wall!! NO!!! Seriously! OH yeah your opt out of receiving adds works the exact opposite of what you want. You guys ask for our emails so you"

            "THIS GAME IS SOOOOO ADDICTING!!!!!! I've literally played this game all night and there is two awesome versions. the adventure and the regular game and both are super fun and challenging as you keep playing. Plus a bonus game when you go to settings and hit more games that's also super cool and Tetris like. And there is no ads except when you run out of space and want to revive. Then you watch a short ad. I cannot recommend this game enough!!!",
            "This game is literally so fun. If you are stressed it is the perfect way to calm down and relax. The only this is that it has ads, always containing ads after you play the game and run out of space. Also, I had to close out the game before it gave me the ad, and when I logged back in, it gave me the ad!",
            "Small 9x9 board, hige blocks; game ends abruptly at odd pre-determined score level so ads can be served. lots of play stalls. unchallenging/boring. Sometimes restarts with an already-full board, gives a \"no spaces available\" message, anx jumps immed. into another 2nd repeat ad. Too much waiting time. Avoid. I uninstalled.",
            "Started out great. Loved figuring out strategy. However, now am getting frustrated with the ads. There are 2 types that ruin the game completely...goes to a black screen and can't do anything but get out and start all over, and the other one is the video commercials that go to a gray screen with 'learn more' in center of screen then a small x finally shows up on corner. No matter how many times you tap the x nothing happens. If you keep tapping it eventually will go back to the game.",
            "Fun but problematic. The gameplay is fine, but the ads keep messing it up. Some ads will just be a black screen, no getting out of it. so I have to exit and wait a bit before I can play again. I've encountered a few ads that never have a x option, so again, I have to close the game and wait. If they get better ads, I'll bump up the stars because it really is a fun game."

            "This game is HORRIBLE! The amount of ads during my game play is just so annoying. In the ad for the game itself, you have plenty of options for outfits and it seems like there's much more to do. However, you literally always get the same hairs, same outfits, and the bot is always picking the wrong stuff. So, it's not even a challenge.",
            "A game made simply to soak up ad revenue from bots and bored folk. No level select and after level 60 the levels begin to repeat. The goofy body modification is barely touched throughout the \"game\" so even playing it ironically just to laugh at the ridiculousness isn't worth the constant ad interruption every 20 seconds. If you're gonna make a trash ad grab game then at least go all out with the goofy body mods and allow folks a level select.",
            "I give it a three because the first two levels they Don't have ADS then. Afternoon's first, who is starts to have ADS. Adds, then I look at the comments and then I thought it would be way worse. And they give you a specific one you have to do. Do not download this at all!!",
            "I would rate this a 0. They gave me ADS every 2 seconds when I downloaded this app. I thought I was gonna be able to make my own outfit. They gave me outfits to fake and if I didn't complete that complete them. I would have failed. So I showed my friends this game. They got annoyed at it. I would not recommend downloading this I also got annoyed.",
            "Sometimes there's ads that forcedly open a new window and when you come back the game resets, so you lost all the rewards and watched multiple ads in vain. Plus the last boyfriend (Fred from Scooby-Doo?) isn't on the boyfriends tab, so the moment you switch him for other you literally lose him forever and can't use him anymore nor get him again. Not the worst game ever but still not worth it at ALL, don't waste your time downloading"

        "comments": [
            "The game is addicting but it's almost impossible to play more then a couple rounds at a time due to the cost of each round and the amount they reward makes it impossible to get ahead unless you spend a lot of money! Your rewards don't always get credited I noticed on one of the trails the trail present that I landed on didn't credit me and that wasn't the first time! I love the graphics & the character!",
            "Fun game but set up to make you lose!!! The game itself is really cute with great graphics but it is ridiculous how much to pay to play a level and the game is set up to where you almost HAVE to buy coins to be able to play for a decent amount of time. It is ridiculous that I have it down to one or two tiles left to get rid of and 10 spare dominoes to change and none of them match and you lose the level. I really enjoy playing it but can't seem to play that much. Do not recommend",
            "Any good review of this game is fake or from a in game review popup for credits within the first 10 levels. Once you reach level 70 it's all down hill from there, you cannot progress any further without spending astronomical amounts of money. It's like a switch and very obvious. I blew through $8.99 (120,000 coins) In just the 8 levels following level 70. Following level 80 you will not even get halfway through a single level. This game is the definition of a bait and switch scam.",
            "Luck Based and Pay-to-win. I ran out of coins, so it's hard to make any progress at level 120 or so, at chapter 5. The game itself is mostly luck based. Even the few times where you have a choice of more than 1 possible move, the best move is random. Oh, and every time I open the app, there's 8 pop-ups for random deals that I have to close!",
            "This game was fun and exciting but now I am on level 10 and it takes up to 20 stars which cost 20 games to complete one task and even that would not be so bad if it gave you the opportunity to win after 5 times playing. It seems to cause you ultimately to have to spend money on the tokens needed to play the game. You can finally win if you play long enough. I do, however, like the updated trail, and I look forward to other ideas that will make it great"

            "This game is addictive, simple, and cute to play! An amazing game to play if you wanna pass by time. I love that it's customizable and there are just so many things you can do! Although the one thing that is bringing it down to a 3 star is that if you wanna change servers to play with a friend or leave a toxic world, you have to start all over. It's very sad and annoying. It would be a 5-atar if you could change servers and keep your progress.",
            "The devs allow this game to reduce the volume of all your other apps without your permission and it's mandatory. Also, who thought it was a good idea to have your mushroom evolve into an anime human not even that far into the game? So lame.",
            "As a new game there's still lots to change and adjust. This game is actually good, I enjoy the customization options! Really cute lol. But something you need, gold, exp need to drop from enemies no matter what. You get stuck and the only way is by summons to get gold and exp. You get stuck and you have to wait til a reset. As I'm having to replay a stage because I can't beat the boss I'm literally stuck...no gold, xp or lamps drop. Change those and push more content and this game is great!",
            "Pay to play basically, and 95% pay to win so don't waste your time trying this game. To progress you're almost required to spend money. The events are 90% pay to participate. Good luck completing the 7 Day trial challenges without spending. The level progression is trash as well and instead of basing it off of enemies you're killing its based off of items recieved which come at a slow rate so you're more likely to pay to progress.",
            "Game advertises as idle, but it isn't. You power up by equipment. Which you must open 1 lamp/box at a time. There is a shake animation, then you compare stats and decide to sell or equip. You get a lamp for each area you beat, and 4 for each boss area, among other ways. Your idle time that you are aware also generates lamps. So you are stuff just looking at a screen of equipment for like 75% of the game. Your game won't progress unless you rinse and repeat the repetitive animations."

            "Each level has 2-3 puzzles, first a very easy one, then more difficult. If you fail the more difficult puzzle, you start the level over from the beginning, meaning you have to replay the easy one before it will even let you retry the hard one. Replaying the same puzzles over and over is very annoying and boring. There's also a time limit on each level, but they don't give you enough time. You can watch an ad for more time, but the game already too many ads. More ads than game time.",
            "Too many ads. Fun little time waster ruined by yet another developer that thinks \"how many ads per minute\" rather than \"how many ads per player\". Step 1, make the game fun, step 2 monitize without completely ruining step 1. The extra bolt, daily bonuses, undo button, ect should be a great source without the player feeling like its forced. 2 stars instead of 1 because forced ads are the short type.",
            "The game is fun, but i have two issues. One the number of ads is obnoxious. Especially the ones that are a 30 second video, than a mandatory interactive screen, then another static streen after. Two, the difficulty of the levels is usually well calibrated, but I took issue with hidden screw holes since you can't plan for them on the first try. The level feels too very difficult until you randomly come across a screw hole that was hidden by a board that you wouldnt have thought to move.",
            "It would be good if it didn't have two separate levels in one, putting the easy first and hard last. I just play this game for the hard puzzles, and it's very annoying having to completely reset right after almost finishing the puzzle onto something I have finished 50 times. It makes the game feel very repetitive and gets worse after getting hit with something like, \"Spend a ticket or watch an ad to undo one move,\" as I just want to play the game to have fun, not spend time watching ads for it.",
            "Game is super fun. Ads are absolutely ridiculous. They are 45-60 seconds long (or more) and required constantly, so many it actually inhibits gameplay. If the ads were shorter, it wouldn't be bad, but they are 35 seconds, then 15 seconds, then 5 seconds, then 5 more seconds, then 3 seconds....EACH AD. I get it, the devs want us to pay for ad free. There's a line that keeps free players playing AND ad revenue flowing, but they've crossed it."

            "It was great! So much fun, and so satisfying. I would love to give this a five star, but unfortunately there were a couple bugs I found. Often when there would be an add, it would freeze and go dark. The only way it would unfreeze was when I swiped out of the app, that made me lose all my progress on the map I was just on. It also wouldn't give me the percent that I had gotten before it froze. Its not too big of a deal, but that was why it couldn't be a five star.",
            "Don't believe anyone else's reviews. I DELETED this game after just an hour playing it. The Insane amount of ADs on this game ruins it. When an ad appears every 30 seconds and gives you a \"No Thank You\" option, but when you click it, it just sends you to another ad... So what's the purpose of it. So unless you pay for No ADs, this game is unbearable. It's nothing like the website!",
            "This game Would be fun if it wasn't for the \"Break time\" ads in the middle of a game. I swear, they give you like 2 of these things right when I'm trying not to get my trail get cut off by another player which I think are bots. I die usually after these things and they could definitely give me as many ads they want after a round of me trying to win. Please fix this as it is very very annoying. Thank you",
            "It's a good game it just has a lot of ads. For example, when I start a new place on a map and I get at least 3 kills, it plays an ad. Also, it gets kind of boring when you get all the skins except legendary ones (the ones you have to use real money for ), and they don't really ad in new ones like I think the game would be a little bit better if they had a bigger choice of skins for this game.",
            "Far too many ads, the ads itself just doesn't make any sense. I'm not saying a game shouldn't have them but these ads just feel forceful. As soon as you kill three players you're hit with an ad about some power up, it doesn't even matter if you decline it or not either. The game itself is fun! (Cool updates!) but the ads just ruin everything for it. I'd prefer the older version of this game, at least they didn't shove ads down your throat"

            "25 turns to break 120 objects that take 2 matches next to it to break it. 240/25 = a minimum of six matches next to breakable objects each turn. Don't even get me started on the mail boxes or magic hats. Good clean fun for about 400 levels then it's pay or wait out the RNG. You will eventually win any level even without using power ups or money, I hardly ever do, but get ready to just lose a bunch till it gives you a pity win for certain levels.",
            "To be honest ..I love this game BUT.. IN order to move forward and get to the highest levels you have to spend a lot of money it's crazy. You don't get enough coins rewards for each level you bit,but if you lose ..you have to pay 900 coins firts try,1900 second ,and like that increasing untill you end up broke and have to buy more coins .",
            "ADD \"MOVE REWIND\" - My name is Aaron this is a great game! I like playing it a lot there's a few things that could improve but I'm just hoping one of them could be adding like a \"MOVE REWIND\" let's say you make a move and you messed up by accidentally tapping the screen or just didnt like the way things played out, you can then use you power up \"MOVE REWIND\" and try again.",
            "The game is called FREE with in-app purchases. You're gonna get to levels that require power ups in order to pass. That said, the power ups don't work every time. For example, the dynamite keg plus rocket is supposed to launch 3 rockets both horizontally and vertically. Well, only 1 rocket gets counted on these larger targets. That's just one example. Device type doesn't seem to matter for this complaint. It's either a built in scam, or they never did a beta test.",
            "I really enjoyed the game at first. However, the higher your level gets the more impossible it is to pass those levels unless you pay for more coins to help. I can tell you I've spent several times trying to pass certain levels without paying and I almost always end up getting 1 more hit and I would have completed the level. I like complex games but it takes the fun out of it sometimes when you have do the same level so many time or pay to progress."

            "My kids and I love this game and gace had it for a long time, payed for no adds. And have a Tom over level 60. But I give 1 star because here the past couple days. The fly points wont go up past 102. And the mini/ bonas games wont load at all. It is upsetting because The worm/ snake game 8s the only thing i really like to do. And it wont load. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it amd it wont work right. Please please fix this glitch?",
            "I used to play this game as a child. It had a feature where it was hard to get some super rare items, and it took time to get them. I would spend hours hoping to get them and I would miss being able to show my rare items to my friends. Now they had an update where every item has no rarity and costs 3-10 coins. It's incredibly boring now since there's not reason to play for rarity.",
            "The game is cool and a lot better than My Talking Tom, except for in terms of clothes, accessories and decorations. Wish there were more selection in these categories. The mini games are also cooler. Except for the controls in Space Trail. They're extremely wonky and the snake is hard to control. I also don't like getting duplicate cards. So to recap: More clothes, accessories, decorations, get rid of the chances of getting duplicates, and fix the controls in Space Trail, and I'll rate higher. Also, the game keeps crashing and freezing to the point were I have to exit out.",
            "So far, my daughter loves the game. However, I'm noticing when we have the option to spin the wheel, she never gets more than 20 or 30 airplanes or 5-10 coins. I watch ad after ad trying to get extra spins to try to earn things for her and I get the same results. I can see every few spins getting the lowest prize, but every single time? This is very frustrating.",
            "It's a good game for the most part. But there should be more variety of mini games, even the ones from the original My Talking Tom would do. The mini games are bland in my opinion. I like the concept of Tom having his own pet, but each of them should have a different voice. I like the idea of using a plane to get gifts, but getting coins and stars can be difficult. I would recommend adding coins to mini games with the plane fuel. There should also be a larger variety of clothing for Tom."

            "Seems a near perfect clone of the original, and doesn't give me an upcoming loss of support warning (so maybe that won't be an issue later?) I turn my Internet off before playing so I get zero ads. I do miss out on online play this way, but I got it for the offline sandbox experience, and online play is only a later afterthought. Works perfectly for me, played it for hours on my first go, happy for more soon.",
            "This game is okay but there is way too ads and me and my brother tried to play but there was so many ads we can't even see each other for like at least 10 without being disturbed by the freaking ads I do not like it's an okay but if you're going to do adventures or something like do not download this game cuz this is not for you!!! that's just me!! That's why I give 3 stars but I would give it 3in a half if I could!!!",
            "Seems like a good game, but I can't really say for sure because every 15 seconds another ad interrupts, and then it sends me back to the loading screen. I wasn't even able to look at the settings without ads interrupting. If you are looking for a game to play then don't download this one. If you are looking for advertisement then this is the one you want.",
            "I love how crazy how good it actually is. I just downloaded a random thing to use for a 3d graph for drawing. But when I opened it to us it it's was just like minecraft (had minecraft before just deleted it by accident). Three stars not for the ads cause I can live with them, but for the fact that every time I click out of them it brings me back to the loading screen kinda obnoxious",
            "It looks like Minecraft with some odd textures for things like stone. The only reason for the poor review is the ads. First time I used it, I played for a few hours without any ads, but ever since I have been getting about an ad a minute. I think it would be better if they set it up where you have a set number of ads when you start a new world, come back from a different screen, or open the command bar. If that doesn't happen, I might declare the game unplayable. 7/8/2022. Deleting. Unplayable."

            "not bad. fun distracting time killer. Update: Changing from four to two stars. Well, after four days, not so much fun now. After only about 10 levels it's getting exponentially difficult to the point I cannot advance. Uninstalling rather than waste more time on a futal effort. A sheer genius might be able to keep playing, but that's a very tiny group, and they probably aren't wasting time playing games.",
            "Decent time killer. It's pretty simple, match the tiles of the same color to remove a spot and to win the game. I like the fact that there are minimal ads, but you can watch ads to win rewards instead of using coins. Speaking of which, coins seem to be easy to use up and perhaps a little harder to gain. I only gave 4 stars because even though I know I haven't gotten to hard levels yet, I think there should be more challenging levels.",
            "A fun game absolutely destroyed by invasive ads. Put ads between the levels, fine. But to have ads without any way to turn off their volume, or ads that jump you to the Play Store every time you try to close them, it's beyond infuriating, it's insulting. It's forcing the player's hand. Give me an ad. Make me watch it for 5, 10, even 15 seconds. But do not give an ad that forces open the store three times in a row before it even gives you the option to close it. Worst ad algorithm I've ever seen.",
            "Excellent game, extremely entertaining, and easy to pick up. I would give it 5 stars but I have one issue with it. The cost for removing ads is $7.99 which is pretty steep. I went ahead and paid it because I love this game and want to be able to play it more on my breaks. The $7.99 ad removal only removes the ads that pop up at the start of each level. It does not remove the ads that you have to watch to open up the free spaces or power ups. For $7.99 it should remove all ads, not just some.",
            "Not as difficult as some people are making it out to be - challenging at times but definitely fair. Simple to play game that doesn't feel like it was made for a 2yr old. Don't mind the ads too much because they're in between levels but it getting kinda annoying when they're long and unskippable. Still better than most free to play games out there now."

            "Good game, it's fun, teaches about timing, but one of my downfalls of this game is whenever my battery is the slightest bit low like about 10%-5% it starts getting really glitchy, to the point where I will be dead but the music is still playing. And yes I have done everything, I've reset my phone, I've cleared storage, I've been in a 100% working Internet environment, and it still does not work. Still a good game I would recommend and if you don't have the same problem as me then Its a nice game",
            "The ads can get a little annoying at times but are very minimal and don't interrupt your gameplay. One issue is the auto checkpoints, often I will use them in practice and it will spawn right before a spike or during a jump, so every time I respawn, I die. I've tried turning it off and placing checkpoints myself, but it's too hard to do while multitasking. It would be nice to have pre-placed checkpoints for every level.",
            "The game is good except \"Dash.\" The level Dash keeps lagging on the ship and a little bit after the ship into the robot for a short period of time, I can't fix this problem because the settings won't help. I don't know why the ship is making my phone lag but I just want to be able to play the level lag free. Another thing is, that all the new levels are insane difficulty, I think it would be better to have lower difficulty levels so we can have more levels each update than just one single level.",
            "even though this isn't the full version of geomatry dash, it's still amazing. With more levels than meltdown and subzero, and there are more difficult levels to vary. I would consider getting this if you don't want to buy the full version. The music is a absolute banger. The only thing that I do not like is the ads. It's literally every time you die a couple times or when you beat the level. I don't know if geomatry dash can do this, but please add more demon levels. I really enjoy club step!!!",
            "a great skill game, you have meny levels to play and can get cool things, by doing challenges like new colors and new characters. it's really good but stressful if you don't have good practice. it's also fun to uninstall the game and reinstall it so you can get stuff again. the ads are annoying but easy to stop, just go offline before you enter the game. it's also nice to record the music of the levels. and there's no inappropriate stuff, and it's really fun try it yourself!! so five stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

It keeps the game gripping and entertaining. However, it can get super irritating to update it every time you change seasons. Overall, it's great and I highly recommend it.",
            "I love this game. It's an instant classic. The endless running, the new locales, the incredible visuals... My only criticisim is I wish there was a way to just play classic subway surfers with no world tour. Don't get me wrong, I love the World tour, it's just... I want a taste of nostalgia for once. Other than that, God tier.",
            "Great game, the season events keep things fresh and exciting. However, it's annoying that players have to wait for each tier of season hunt rewards to unlock. What's the point of collecting tokens if you have to wait? It makes the entire process feel boring, and cheap. Let players have access to rewards as soon as they earn them so they can actually enjoy the accomplishment.",
            "I love all the characters in the game and how challenging it get thru out the run. It's very entertaining 😁 I just don't like how it can be slow sometimes. It sometimes doesn't let me watch the add to get my prise, even if I have full bars. And I have to get to x8 speed just to go to the next level on something...If this gets fixed,then it will probably be a 5.",
            "I used to play subway surfer when it first came out, but this new Verizon is updated and it's amazing. The graphics 10/10, Characters 10/10, music 10/10. Overall everything about this game is good. Yeah it has ads but so you can get things, like power ups and such. And I believe you can play off line I haven't tried yet but for ads off line, you won't be able to do anything. But you can still play the game if you don't have wi-fi you just have limited stuff."

            "Irritating! First, let's just say the game itself is not bad. The graphics are ok. The questions are not extremely hard. It would be enjoyable but it is so very irritating to watch an ad after every single question! The ads are longer than the actual game time, totally ridiculous. And then the ad freezes and you have to restart the game. I'm not sure why this got so high of a review. I understand ads are necessary but not like this. I will be deleting this game.",
            "Decided to come back and update my comments. I actually enjoy this game. Sometimes I get wrong answers when I'm not paying close enough attention re: names 🙃....it is amazing the things I have actually learned while playing this game. One thing for sure I wish they would get rid of Harry Potter, Friends and a few other shows. I never ever watched any of these two shows but I lose quite frequently when I'm asked questions about these 2 shows which seems to come up quite a bit. Bleh 😵.",
            "Fun game. It has issues though. Ads play at full volume unless each is muted separately. Makes it hard to play in, say, a doctor's office. Ads also crash the game at an alarming rate. Scree just goes black & locks up. When you restart you lose your previous progress. I'm ok with it because I'm just playing for the questions. If you really want to advance in the game this will frustrate you no end.",
            "I really wanted to like this. Two bad things within the first 5 minutes. 1 - I turned the sound and music off in settings as I like yo play at work, but when the first add came on it blew out the speaker so everyone could hear. 2 - with that loud ad it also stuck me in some weird loop switching between the ad and the app store. Sorry folks but this is a loser.",
            "I enjoy trivia and this would've been a nice app if not for the constant ads. Every 3 questions then an ad that takes longer than the question round itself. The ads have no mute so it's sudden blaring sounds. I don't want to turn down my phone's volume, and the game settings only apply to the game not the ads. Uninstalling because of the annoying ads not the game itself."

        "recentChanges": "[New Feature]<br>The Battle Report Assistant will be active in more battle reports to help you achieve the next glorious victory!<br>[Optimizations]<br>General&#39;s Trial - Alliance Challenge optimization:<br>- The enemy will be divided into multiple troops, the number varies according to the difficulty level.<br>- A single rally battle can continuously repel the Enemy Troop multiple times.",

            "The game is constantly disconnecting, even after uninstall reinstall. My home wifi is stable, the game is unstable. It's next to unplayable. Not to mention the number of micro transactions, there are so many. You can not get legendary heroes for free. They need to add a way to limit who can join your rally. You should be able to block players under a certain power from joining when you are trying to fight a big monster. It's almost impossible to kick w/ rejoining. There are no ads at least.",
            "The graphics are nice, pretty polished. The ux is cluttered, and there are tons of things to click on and lots of ways to spend money... BUT, the actual game play is boring as hell. It's so basic and automatic that it takes ZERO thought or skill. You slide your little people left and right, and THAT'S IT. You don't even have to think. You just move them to the blue lane. It feels super non-interactive for as busy as it is. Feels like a weak attempt to disguise the money pit it's drooling to be.",
            "The game is cool and fun to play. The reason for the 3 stars is the extremely long time it takes to build/upgrade. If you plan on playing this game w/ no money or minimal money spent, I wouldn't waste my time. Taking 2, 3, 4+ days to upgrade a building or training soldiers is wild. You spend more time waitin for upgrades/training than playing. I feel the building/training speed could be decreased so ppl spend more time playin rather than waiting. Will change my review if this improves.",
            "Fun game but highly predatory constantly pushes \"deals\" or \"value buys\" in your face with no way to turn those things off. It's game with pay to win mechanics that has a free to play option, which makes being able to participate in the events of the game impossible. By the time a free to play player is able to do anything, most of the people they know will have left the game and moved on. Would give less stars if I could",
            "The screenshots of the game (what's shown in ads) is probably less than 5% of the game. And it's no where near what they show. Main game is building a base behind artificial time gates. You can play for a couple of hours before you are forced to a halt behind long build times and progress becomes non existent unless you pay for boosts."

            "It's good. I used to photo option when shopping for hardware supplies that I was completely overwhelmed by today. I often use the audio input option to build out study guides with material for tech certifications and sometimes it will randomly add weird stuff to what I've said. Often it adds \"thanks for watching!\" But otherwise it is great.",
            "I upgraded to the paid version because I wanted more recent results (4/2023 instead some time in 2022). Ever since then it is very slow, halting, stops in the middle of an answer, and frequently provides incorrect and even ludicrous answers. I'm canceling and going back to the free version, which was fantastic. I'd be happy to pay if it worked right. Very disappointing and annoying",
            "Been using this as a research tool for a big writing project, and it's EXTREMELY helpful. You can give it a whole paragraph of highly specific questions, and get perfectly relevant, detailed, well sourced responses. I've used it for many other things like travel, and it comes in handy anytime you need info of any kind really. I haven't used the vocal features, so I can't attest to those. But if you're a writer or any kind of human really, the research aspect is extremely useful.",
            "I love this thing. It has 10x'd me productivity and completely transformed the way I learn, my workflow, the volume and quality of my output, and amazed me in countless ways. The Whisper integration really tops it off. To have this voice with inflection delivering the responses with all the amazing logical reasoning capabilities of GPT4 is just... amazing. On long drives, I have some of the best two-way conversations with this thing I could go on forever but I'm running out of space. I LOVE this",

DuckDuckGo is blocking repeated attempts of this app attempting to phone home with my device details and PII. The update installed on 2024.02.09 is not working. I am unable to connect to the service and receive the following error, \" Unable to connect, try again later.\" The app was working perfectly prior to the update."

It's ridiculous and a waste of time. Why can't the ad be short like 5 or 10 seconds? Or at least none to begin with?",
            "So far my information is safe and secure, while not being intruded by the unwanted advertising, and(or) personal information sharing. So far, PDF reader(basics) is a free service, more versitile, and easy to convert documents from other apps(eg., banks, microsoft, windows, outlook, etc,.); and I have yet to transverse platforms, such as copying my home computer docs.(AKA, pdf or ms document formats) . So far so good, but we shall see if this app can continue offering these benifits & options.👍",
            "Dude the advertising is dumb. Gets in the way. After every file I opened, I had to watch a clip or click the X in the top corner which somehow most of the time took me to the advertisement webpage! {Instead of simply X` ing out like it should. I'd have to click back a few times just to try click the X again... JUST TO GET BACK TO MY DOCUMENT I was just viewing, or to folder where I was simply just trying to view the files and find which one I needed}. Tedious & def not worth ad free paid version",
            "Great PDF Reader! You can highlight, copy the text, rename the file, etc. The menu is clean, organized, and easy to manipulate files in. I was just looking to highlight text in my pdfs, so this meets my needs fine. Please note there is a brief ad when switching files and a banner ad when viewing a file. Thanks to the team/developer for making this absolutely free!",
            "Sorry, I am not willing to sit through a 3-minute unskippable misleading ad for a game I've seen a million times just to open a PDF that my wife sent me. (In response to developer and another user) I totally get that ads are a source of revenue. I'm not opposed to them at all. But when the ad is literally three minutes long, cannot be skipped without closing the app, and is the very first thing I see when I launch it for the first time, that doesn't leave a good impression at all."

            "I installed Instabridge just to check it out. First time trying to use it and all I had was a list of \"rarely works\" Wi-Fi options. I wish I could get back the time it took me to install the app and now delete the app. I could have spent that 4 minutes, watching some senseless YouTube video and felt better about the lost time.",
            "Instabridge,is by far the best app for hooking onto and into any wifi so you can get on line when it counts the most, not to mention the stability is awesome the other apps I have tried don't even come close in comparison. delete all the other apps that claim connection to wifi and map it out , cause this app will be the only app you will ever need.",
            "Absolutely awful! It completely took over my phone, rearranged EVERYTHING. Constant ads everywhere. When you really look at the permissions, you see that this app has now become the system your phone works on and everything that that entails. Oh yeah, it also downloads apps and files... Without your authorization of course. And you have to do some research to uninstall it, because that feature is also not available. NO!!!!",
            "This app ruins my phone and wouldn't let me delete it, I did not really commend you downloading it, and it damages the Wi-Fi in the places you're at, I download it, and this is happened, I really don't recommend it, and you will get in trouble for it in that place, and it completely changes your phone, iPad, whatever you using, and you can slide and ads will pop up. When you're trying to open your phone, don't download it. Really don't recommend. This will ruinwhatever you're using!",
            "I would rate this less than one star, but that is not possible, I completely takes over your browser and it adds files, downloads, apps without your permission, and it will completely take over your phone and I'll give you ads randomly when you on your homescreen and it randomly pops up with stuff on your home screen. It pops up with a whole lot of Internet stuff and if you try to click on the Internet it doesn't really work because it tells you to get a password and permission from the owner"

If I try to close the pop up message or tap the back button, it closes the entire app. In short, the app is useless without a $70/year subscription.",
            "I need a simple workflow - download PDF, open PDF. I installed Adobe because I trust they won't install spyware. EVERY time this app opens, it pops-up ad to try the 7-day premium editing features. No problem, just close the window. But then it doesn't show the file I just downloaded?! THEN, I try to open the file, and it lists them alphabetically with no option to sort by download date. FAIL! I uninstalled.",
            "The app would be great but for the constant nags to try a streamlined reading mode, even if you use it all the time, even including occasional full-screen pop over nags when you just want to open a doc to take a quick peek. In addition, it constantly highlights features that are not available without a paid monthly subscription. This app is basically an advertisement for a paid monthly subscription for features I rarely need. Regretfully uninstalling, as I really like the core functionality.",

Plus, I can choose a 2, 7, 14, or 30-day time frame to be reflected on my data charts. All in 30 seconds. I can view this information on Samsung Notes, Acrobat, or several other options. I'm not savvy online, but the Dexcom Clariy App is easy for me to use. My new Dexcom G7 has changed my Diabetes control in positive ways!",

The app works primarily the same as the software for your desktop or laptop. I am truly interested in checking out the fully armed app and finding out what features that I'm missing out on. I've been dabbling with computers and software since the early 80's and I consider Adobe one of the better software companies.They seem to have a an outstanding quality control department."

It's this way with most free applications that have anything to do with an office type needs. I find this disheartening because it seems Microsoft has free reign, while smaller developers have no chance of finding their small space in the market of a giant conglomerate.",

I didn't even use it for editing—it was such a chore to read docs alone. Can't recommend",
            "Literally just horrible. App is slow and glitchy and straight up locked me inside of the app trying to swipe out but the app page would pop back up instantaneously after trying to close the app. Had to turn off my phone and let it sit for a minute before I was finally able to delete the app. Let alone nothing loads in the app even with given file permission. This app is sketch even if it works well for others. Fix your problems.",

Underlining and so on..u get the idea. But I truly love that it keeps track of your documents in a file system that make everything easier to find things...ty for that.",

A doc that is save can only be viewed unless you spend wasteful amount of time saving it in other apps for editing. Text box editing doesn't line up and opens a canvas. It looks pretty but waste a lot of your time. The pen is not for signing because it doesn't show the writing."

Sometimes I'm missing a image from the file when I go to add an image there might be one that doesn't show up and I don't understand why I can't convert it to a pdf with my other images. Like today I was only able to make 9 out of 10 images to PDFs. Because the image isn't showing up to use. Can some one explain? (update: it showed up after a few times resaving image from sms)",

It's like a digital paper that maintains the original formatting, fonts, and images, regardless of the device or operating system you use. PDFs are great for sharing important documents, like resumes, contracts, or reports, because they preserve the layout and can be easily opened by anyone with a PDF reader. It's",

            "My printer fully relies on an app, which I'd never have gotten if I knew it was this bad. The app has been giving me grief for a while due to my printer disconnecting regularly and the app failing to process print jobs and giving no reason. Now my printer has ceased functioning entirely because the app simply says there's \"a problem with the printer\", No hint as to what. I just put in new ink cartridges and the report pages print fine. If it's not too late, don't waste your time with HP.",
            "My issue is with the update done on the HP SMART APP. The update no longer allows you to do a printer scan using the mobile HP SMART APP. It gives an error message as follows: Feature Unavailable This feature is not supported by the selected printer, Connect to a different printer to use this feature. Contact HP Support. The app used to work perfectly from a mobile phone. Now it's awful. Why don't HP just fix the app the way it was to allow printer scanning from the mobile app. So frustrating!!!",
            "Horrible!! I absolutely abhore this app and their printers. You need a subscription to use certain inks cartridges or it won't print. The printer is always glitching out so it doesn't print. To be able to use the printer you have to turn on all these intrusive settings. The printer is extremely slow. All I want is to have a printer that connects easily and prints easily. This company fails to provide that. Extremely frustrating product - now we need subscriptions to use printers. Horrendous.",
            "if I didn't have to power it off and unplug every time I needed to use it, this would be a great printer and scanner. the HP smart app takes forever to load. half the time I need to clear cache and Uninstalled and reinstall and log in online for it or work properly. the intention is great. when it works it's great. the problem is getting it to work. not reliable.",
            "Im not sure if its the apps fault or the printer itself, regardless, its a pain in the neck to use. Was extremely difficult to set up for some reason, had to be on the phone with support for a half hour or more. Even then, it still has issues connecting to the network, when all other devices in home connect seamlessly. Id go for a different company for printers."

Error codes, I follow all steps of reboots and change equipment but still remain. I have mobile as well, overall pretty good. Could be my phone , but at times, I lose service. Honestly, I think they should give you a package to pick what you want. They add $2.95 a month for a sport's channel, something I do not want.",
            "I wish I could give a negative number but can only do 1 star, Xfinity has really dropped the ball on the phone app you use to be able to change passwords, names, add items to your wifi, now you can't do anything, you can't even pay the bill, most of the time the app doesn't even work, and when you call in the tech isn't trained very well, and I end up helping them, it's terrible.",
            "Just horrible. Absolutely the worst app. It is very slow, unresponsive, changes fail to save after taking several minutes. Help is a blank page. It WILL make sure your bill gets paid though... even though there is never any compensation for the constant service outages. It's just awful. I think I'll change internet service providers because this thing is complete garbage. UPDATE: Continues to be garbage! After logging in four or five times in still going in circles trying to pay my bill! ARG!",
            "We are consistently having problems with our cable lately -- programs freezing, getting error messages and being booted from recordings, playback issues with recordings, randomly re-setting, etc. It is SO frustrating and you can never reach someone easily! Our bill keeps going up, but the service gets worse! I'm just about done with Xfinity! If I could, I would give ZERO stars!",
            "I don't know how long there's been an issue with the app. As of today, the feature to assign, pause and put my PC to sleep is missing. I set it to block internet after a certain time so my kids can't sneak on while I'm asleep. Well I'm using it and it stops. Takes me a minute to realize i set it that way. I go to the app to wake it up and I haven't managed to do it yet. Googled for help and says to go under the Wi-Fi tab. There's no Wi-Fi tab. Just overview, services and account. So frustrating."

            "The application imposes daily usage limitations on the GPT-4 AI, even for subscribers with unlimited access. Despite the AI's capabilities remaining unchanged, the app employs content censorship, lacks comprehensive formatting tools, and falls short in providing diverse writing styles and tones compared to Samsung's offering. Please note that the information provided is based on the knowledge cutoff of September 2021 and may be outdated. Additionally, the app currently lacks voice commands func",
            "Outstanding! Wow. What an awesome app. I asked for twelve multiple choice questions on a God theme for a church Quiz that I run every month, and for between the ages of 15 - 30 year olds, and Instantly; \"Pow!\" ... It gave me exactly what I had asked, and they 'will' be used on my next quiz to take place on the Sunday, 24th, March, 2024. I will definitely be using CHATBOT AI again. This app is second to none. 😘👌 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Love it. ✅",
            "It has no interaction with ones phone, it only offers text based AI in order to speak. You have to copy the item and paste it in text to speak, because it can't do that for you. Waste of money. Find a better affordable ai that can at least talk back and doing something as simple as email a friend.",
            "The functionality is excellent and I get perfect results in each of my search. If there was anything higher than just a five star, I give the app because I feel I under rated it. I will recommend this to anyone I know that is in need of knowledge because this all is loaded and always disposed to help people like me. Thank you the developers, you have done a great job",
            "It's good, but one huge downfall, is the AI Bot doesn't remember past conversations which is a huge shame for me. So over time the Bot doesn't get to know you or familiarise itself with the user. For example if a User adds birthdays for example, the Bot totally forgets on other conversations. Shame because that is what makes Bots good, you can name them, or familiarise the Bot around the end user."

            "Honestly,I love this app. . I just find it odd that sometimes it says 2000 characters , other times it says 4,000 and sometimes it gives me the option to be precise, casual, or professional, whereas the other times it does not. Why?? I get a little to wordy when I'm writing but this app makes it more concise; since I am a Microsoft 365 customer, I also get help for writing errors as well as other items that the free option does not have for example, in Microsoft Edge and Word, so it's great",
            "I don't know what Microsoft was doing when they made their own phones but once again, they designed an Android app that is the best in its class. It is a very useful piece of AI and does a very good job at responding both verbally and by text. It can be slightly slower than some of the rest because it also uses the internet to reference information. Keeping that in mind, you won't find a better AI experience on Android (I've checked). This should have been Cortana.",
            "great app... I am looking forward to future updates though. there are definitely some bugs to work out as far as restricted content or verbiage goes. it would als9 be nice if I could go back to previous generated images to work on them further as well. o ly other thing would be the ability to create clips or reels... otherwise it's an amazing app... the only one I actually pay for tbh",
            "I loved this app at first. I was able to do a lot of research and the image generation worked great. The past week, the app keeps freezing up when generating images. Especially when you go to view the image or try to download it. It's made me not want to use it because it becomes too stressful with the constant freezing.",
            "Copilot is the best AI on the market and it's not even close. I really wanted to like Google Gemini, but I've been comparing both when I do research or how to, and Copilot is just next level, way ahead. Copilot is the way to go for now and from a very long time because it's just getting better. Don't settle for less. Get the best in the market."

            "This app has been declining for a few months. I've been having the same glitches as everyone else, like weird autocorrect and capitalization. The new update is not good. Let us choose whatever size we want for our fonts. Why does it only go down to 8, and why can't we enter them manually? Additionally, I've been having a glitch that says that someone else is on the document I'm currently editing even when it's not shared with anyone. It's just annoying.",
            "I've had no choice but to stop using this app. It keeps glitching, turning on caps when I don't want it to, and auto correcting when I don't want it to and not auto correcting when it's obvious that an auto correct is needed. It also pulls the latter paragraph to the current paragraph when it auto corrects a word when I'm editing the current paragraph. Don't get me started on it adding letters to words when I'm backspacing. I'm absolutely tired of this. Third update: Nothing has changed.",
            "I've been experiencing the same issues as many others as far as random capitalizations, cursor jumping to the wrong paragraph, and autocorrecting words that shouldn't be corrected. I've tried clearing my cache and that didn't help. The thing is, this only happens on my Samsung S22 Ultra, but not my old Samsung Note 9 despite both having the latest update. Hopefully this might help you figure out where to look for the bugs in the code if you know it's only affecting newer model devices! Thanks!",
            "Usually it's great and on a computer it works very well, but on mobile, it might be the most atrociously managed and technically trash app I've used. It's very disappointing. I literally type things in a note pad on my phone, so I can copy + paste it over to Docs on mobile just to be able to use it normally on PC. Very unfortunate, the random and fully wrong autocorrect and capitalization makes the app nearly unusable. Quite sad as it's a great idea and used to work excellently. Not worth it now",
            "Convenient platform, buggy app... I love to use docs for my personal projects, and I have been doing so for years. It has worked wonders on desktop; however, for some reason, I experience random capitalization and autocorrecting proper words into.... vomit?? This only occurs on the app version in collaboration with my Samsung keyboard. I have been holding out hope that an update would fix this issue, but it has been nearly 2 months now. Please fix this. I am sincerely heartbroken."

            "I would not recommend this app for QR scanning. When you scan a code instead of popping up with the actual link it pops up with a link to scam websites. It's only if you look around the edge of your screen do you see the tiny subscript \"ad\" message. Do yourself a favor and get an app that if it does have ads, they aren't acting like the code you scanned",
            "A little odd after it was installed. A page popped up to install a QR reader/scanner and I had just done that. I hit the back arrow and got another weird page. So I closed the app, found the icon and started over. A little problem in a dimly lit room but the app has a button to tune the light on. Moved the phone a little bit and it immediately came up with the URL. The original QR scanner worked sporadically and I had deleted it before installing this app. Great extras in this app.",
            "Downloaded this app to set up a TV. It even showed a set up page, as soon as I put in card info ( tv even said it would give a free trial but need card information on file) my bank account got hit with all kinds of random charges. Double checked to make sure I didn't accidently hit an ad and I hadn't. Lost money and had to have my bank account shut down due to this. Save your time, frustration and money and don't use it. It hacks your account and does all kinds of bogus charges!",
            "Still dont work ! Definitely an uninstall. Even updates havent improved the functionality, Good luck developers, seems like this has been kind of a lemon for ya. Could be my devices or internet but ive tried a few times over a year or longer and if it works, it should be WAY easier to navigate. All it does is run the line back and forth thru the barcode scanner frame but wont scan no matter what. Could be doing it wrong ? If so please set me up with directions, and accept my most humble apology.",
            "Undecided about this app. As soon as I installed and scanned I got a pop up asking for my credit card details. I thought I needed to establish identity for a \"free \" account. Found out I will get charged over $30 in 5 days. I don't think the ad is part of the app but it's a very deceptive way of getting people to subscribe to something else. If the developer dose not want to be \"painted with the same brush\" maybe they shouldn't allow these ads."

            "Excellent App. I've scanned many barcodes with quick, excellent recognition.(tiny, damaged, low contrast, etc.) Of course some of this can be dependent on your phone's capabilities. Ads: There is a small ad strip at the bottom of the screen less than finger's width. Not intrusive or confusing at all. Small popup asks you to rate the app. Press \"later\" use the app, then rate it at some point. easy. Results: Options to use Google, Amazon, etc. for results. Info results are as good as what is available on the web. Access to your camera and the ability to retrieve results from the web are the ONLY permissions that have been requested by the app. Confusion: MANY of the negative reviews here are based on a different developer's app. This is an excellent app. If I used this kind of utility more often, I'd buy the pro version without hesitation.",
            "With the Pandemic restaurants are slowly reopening. They are unable to pass out old menus. Many places are printing copies & handing them out. The barcode allows a restaurant to have the menu come up on a smartphone. It's simple to install. The app uses the phones camera to take a picture. It's then becomes a .pdf file which can be saved & relabled with the restaurants name. I then created a folder \"Restaurant Menu's\". I can now order takeout from home & pick it up or use a delivery service.",
            "I just downloaded the app tried to use it once and already popping up to upgrade to the paying version and I declined. When I scanned the QR code I need to find out about because it's from the post office about a letter I'm waiting for, it scans the code and nothing else. Can't click on it, won't open to a new web browser, in fact it does absolutely nothing at all!! Waste of time and all they want you to do is upgrade to the paid version in order for the scanner to properly work!!👎👎👎",
            "works, but takes a while. at first it isn't clear whether it's currently looking for a QR code or whether I need to do something to trigger it, I tweaked the scan box several times and opened and closed the settings menu before it finally recognized the code. This is when lighting and focus were pretty good. But this scanner eventually succeeds where other scanners fail.",
            "After downloading this app, I spent time using the features it offers and I was actually very surprised that it exceeded all of the great reviews it has gotten! I was so skeptical of all the excellent reviews that were so equally complimentary, that I was somehow morphing into a conspiracy theorist! After I spent the time trying to prove it was a marketing set-up, I happily felt like a fool, because they were correct with this one!! It is truly awesome compared to any other one I've used!"

            "I like it, except the app doesn't finish reading out loud long emails. The app keeps saying I need a page to read that and then shuts down. I have to make the time to physically read the long email that I was using the app for to save some time. I liked back when the app allowed you to look at the document as it was being read. It made it easier to take notes. Anyway, for reading short emails, it works fine, but it fails to completely finish reading out loud long emails.",
            "At first I was not too happy when my MSN email was switched to outlook but after trying it out, I now Love it. Outlook separates your email into two major categories: Focused & Others. In addition to Junk. You have the options of selecting which messages are most important and the least significant. You have full control of all of your messages. Easy as pie to use.",
            "Remove Bing Search from Context menu. Then I'll come back. I love Outlook but not if you're going to integrate yourself into my Android. 2/13/14 wow. This app has evolved in the past 2 years easier to use than the PC app, Mac version is better but not by much. Upgraded to 3 stars from 1. Refresh rates are glitchy slow to push on Android. Also doesn't always refresh \"live\" even when trying to sync from iPhone or PC to android.",
            "CAUTION TO OTHER USERS: Not fully syncing emails. I'e been waiting for an email for the past few days and have monitoried my app. The sender resent it several times, yet it is not showing up on my outlook app. Finally, i checked via PC & there they are. During that time I received other emails which on time. After identifying the discrepancy, I attempted to sync the email. I found no option for that. As a result, I now know this app is not as reliable.",
            "Good in some ways but, like so many Microsoft products, it's an anti-productivity tool in others. If you want to go through and delete a bunch of emails at one time you have to oh-so-carefully touch the circle on the side of each one. If you are off by a little bit it opens the email for you or, worse, it unselects everything you've just selected. It is certain that the redundant, fat-salary earners at M-soft who design and produce their products don't use them."

            "How in the world can such a conceptually simple and ancient app lack so many basic features? Can't add custom colors. Can't set it so back doesn't accidentally close a sheet. Images aren't cached. Rearranging sheet order is ridiculously slow. Can't access justify or borders unless in landscape mode. References to cells in other sheets must be done manually. Worst part is that on android, this app is still vastly superior to the web app on both chrome and Firefox based browsers.",
            "It blows my mind that such a rich company can't provide an app with basic functions. First off, this app crashes and or gets held up when entering data. I'll often need to reenter data updates. The undo feature apparently can undo its self enough to close the app. Upon reopening all data entry is lost. I'm running the pixel 7 with high speed internet and great cellular signal. I'm sure the developer will have some excuse. Years of using this app and its never improved. Google need to listen",
            "would be great if it didn't randomly set my shared documents **that I myself created** to view only, thus preventing me from making any further edits. would also be great if i could fix this from mobile, as i have no pc, and it says it can only be changed with pc. furthermore, i find that strange, since the only person i have shared one particular document with also has no pc. so overnight it mysteriously randomly set itself to view only. thanks google. (sarcasm.) it does this with docs too.",
            "I am constantly having issues where Google Sheets goes into view only mode. It'll only happen on certain spreadsheets. I can edit them on desktop so it seems to be an issue with the app. Needing to make edits quickly on mobile and not being able to is extremely frustrating. I have Google One and I'm thinking of switching to a different suite of services altogether because it's really unacceptable now unreliable it is.",
            "I love this app and use it constantly. It would get five stars, except for one thing. You cannot create named ranges, which I would use constantly, if I could. I've tried emailing about it, and get a message saying that the address is no longer being monitored. I'm honestly annoyed. This is the best spreadsheet app I know, but the exclusion of this already-existing feature is seriously hampering my workflow. So I'm making some noise here with the hopes of catching someone's attention."

            "Much faster than adobe when looking a blueprints (pdf's) via android phone or tablet, but is easily overloaded and can \"potentially\" crash often. Has a few bugs when highlighting pdf's and not Being able to view the highlights unless opening documents in another app. But it's still more efficient than Adobe when just viewing via tablet or phone.",
            "Slow to open documents/pdfs..etc. Sometimes, I open a document, and the app doesn't open it. Instead, after a loading screen, it takes me to the recent docs tab, overall sluggish and slow. The experience isn't great, I expected better from microsoft. I hope you remove the annoying loading screen and take me directly to the file i opened without hitches.",
            "Samsung Note 20: it is a wonderful app. Reviewers say you can not move files to other folders. Yes, you can. Open the file, click the three dots, and choose Save As. Now you can choose the location you want to save the file to. A complaint is Outlook Calendar. Search displays data back six months only. To see data older than six months, I use Samsung Calendar. It uses the same data as Outlook does, yet displays data from years ago. On PC Outlook, Search performs as expected.",
            "On the one hand it's convenient to have access to Word documents and Excel worksheets on the phone; on the other hand, the app is pretty limited in function, which is frustrating when you're used to the full functionality (e.g. if there's a way to apply (or even view) conditional formatting in Excel in the app, I haven't found it...). PLEASE get rid of the \"try scanning\" pop-up that interferes with opening documents.",
            "If you'd like an app that allows you to use it in order to get your daily work done.. i'd recommend Adobe acrobat! Works way better than this hot garbage and let's you select more than one file at a time. You'd think with all that money that Microsoft could make a better PDF editing app. Guess not."

            "I'm just not impressed. The app could be much more user-friendly but instead makes it very difficult to use in some areas, especially access sharing and security. The file structure is also a bit wonky. The paid storage is way too expensive! There should be more options available so you don't have to make the leap from free to $200 a year! That's ridiculous! Dropbox has been around for years and I expect more from this company, but they have simply failed to deliver!",
            "This app was pretty good at its job for a long time, but in the past couple weeks it's suddenly gone very downhill. Files upload to the wrong folder and refuse to be moved, downloads are hit-or-miss, and the new visuals take up way too much space on the screen. If the uploads and downloads aren't sorted soon, I will be looking for an alternative.",
            "Today is March 4. Since March 1, Dropbox on my Samsung phone has been very difficult to use. On March 1, I opened it and the files appeared different. Pathways have changed. Photos appear and disappear from their frames. When I gather some photos for transfer to another folder, get asked TO WHICH FOLDER?, choose the 'transfer to' folder... and then Dropbox disappears! I reopen it and have to start over, again and again. Do I need to change something? Dropbox worked great until 2/29.",
            "Use this app almost everyday, it isneasy and definitely comes in handy. Because I can share pictures with anybody. Or I can build an album and give them the link for them. Open pictures and view them themselves. In the best part, no memory sticks to lose. No, I forgot my memory stick at home, or the dreaded my memory stick just failed. Recommend for anyone who stores a lot of pictures, or documents.",
            "I have a 2TB account at Dropbox. They don't have any options to let you transfer your data or pictures over to another provider (i.e. drive). You have to manually do it which essentially makes it very hard to leave them. I want to migrate my data over to drive as they software for managing pictures is so much better and with Google photos you can easily search by name of people linked in your contacts. After 8 years with Dropbox I leaving, once I migrate (manually) to better services platform!"

            "Wants to replace Assistant, but can't perform simple tasks. Can't do much as set a reminder with it, uninstalled within a minute of installing it. A great example of putting the cart before the horse. EDIT 03/03/2024: this functionality was present for a bit but now it's gone again. I'd given it 3 stars when it was working, but back to 1 star since it's now missing. Google really needs to get it's Assistant replacement to work as an assistant.",
            "** update** So it works pretty good and I'm assuming it depends on your phone as well. I'm running it on Samsung Galaxy s21 Ultra. It does do the simple tasks like schedule reminders and alarms. It can open apps and search for video. It can easily plan a trip find all the cheapest flights and you just have to book it. I've noticed it doesn't always work and it looks like it switches between Google assistant and Gemini like two separate apps they quickly combined so I'm sure it will get better.",
            "The app has become unresponsive and even the support email is no longer in service. How does this happen? The app had been working for a while. For those complaining about Gemini taking over assistant, that can be changed in the settings. I do agree Google should not have allowed that change without notifying users. The strange thing is now the app won't even load. I have cleared cache, storage, and even reinstalled the app. All I get is a blank black screen.",

Then when you attempt to change the setting, it gives instructions to go into another, different app to change other settings. All to set a reminder which apparently now I can't do anymore. How could they not test the most basic functionality??! I thought our best and brightest were at Google...",
            "Understanding it's a experimental replacement for assistant. It still can't do as much as assistant can such as playing audio from an app. Additionally, although settings say it will use your location, it doesn't such as asking what the weather is gives weather for the incorrect location. It would also be nice if it read out loud the response automatically if the request was done via voice. If the request was done via voice, it may indicate the user needs to be hands-free."

            "This is a great app. I recommend it to everyone. It does exactly what it claims and it is actually free to use. There has been no interruptions from ads during any of the interactions with Norton Genie. It does not constantly interrupt the interactions with ads to upgrade Norton Genie to the \"premium\" version and it does not have you copy, paste, and submit the email/message text, links, photo to the app, only to reply, \"scanning for scams is accessible with the paid premium version only.\"",
            "I like where this is going but would like to see these features integrated into Norton 360. It should scan email, messages, images without the user having to copy paste or touch them. Copy pasting from email or messages increases the risk of accidentally clicking malicious links or images that lead to malicious websites or tracking images.",
            "Too cumbersome and time-consuming. I for one do not have time to showing you stuff. If you can't block it what good is it. And quite frankly after 30 years with Norton and you charging for things you keep adding is going to turn off a lot of customers. I was led to believe Norton 360 was all I would ever need. But Norton keeps adding expensive add ons'.",
            "It might help people who can't recognize reasonably obvious scam clues, but what it needs is the ability to recognise well designed spam. In particular, it would be a lot more useful if I could upload a full email -- the message text plus the headers -- so that the app could detect when an email was sent from an address other than the one shown as the From. I had one today purportedly from a friend in trouble. But was it really from them or from a scammer wanting me to reply? I can't tell!",
            "so,as I got familiar with genie Norton, I noticed that the more I interacted with it, the better it got. Plus, from what I gather, this app isn't malicious in any kind of way. so if you're a Terminator fan, don't worry, I believe this to be a very informative an influential piece of data."

            "This app was a great app, until I bought something a couple months ago. I've bought things in the past from shein, so I was just expecting a normal arrival. But since I've ordered it in November--(it's currently March), I haven't received it. I thought the package may have gotten lost because it said it was on transit, but then the same thing happened in January, and I still haven't gotten that package either. Im not able to get a refund because it's been so long. I want my 30$ back.",
            "I have been scammed 2 times! One was with a lip tint which is ok it was cheap but then another time was one that I needed like now! And it could not even come! I might delete the app even though l have gotten some good stuff from them! This is just Dissapointing!!!!! I want my stuff! I paid my money and never got a refund at all! I'm super disappointed and I expected better then this",
            "The app has a daily check-in where you can collect and earn points to redeem on purchases. I don't know when the update happened, but I've noticed that my points have been lowering instead of rising. They added a thing where the points expire and it is ridiculous! I do not order often, but I do order! I wish it would go back to how it was before!",
            "Items are pretty good, true to size. However, the recent courier choice for Dubai is a let down. Lazy... Don't want to travel where I live. So I find an alternate address. Aggressive... Shout at me frustration because they can't listen. Arrogant... Traveling without GPS locations and telling me where I went wrong when my instructions are clear to other delivery companies and they never had a problem.",
            "It's the worst app i have ever used. Cannot be trusted. Recently made a purchase and returned a few items and received an incorrect refund for the I have spent over a month trying to explain & get a correct refund. I opened an enquiry, and they closed it without even resolving it than i had to open another enquiry and repeat myself over & over again. If it was $1 i would have let it go but they owe me around $63. Most untrusted."

            "Enter Coupon in temu profile for $100. As an american, I love temu! It's fun, there's a lot of categories you can choose, and it always keeps me entertained. Since I play it a lot, I have noticed some issues lately, however. For example, I'm not sure if it's just my device, but I have been experiencing delays when I swipe, like it either takes longer than expected to move when I swipe or it just doesn't work. Other than that, I definitely recommend this game! Just hope the issue gets fixed soon.",
            "Enter Coupon in temu profile to get $100. Good! This app is so wonderful. However I do have a few problems. 1. When I play with my stylus, the game will sometimes not move and I will die. 2. There are too many ads. There is one every time after I die. Even when I say no to watch an and ad to revive myself, it still shows me an ad anyway. 3. Sometimes when I try to exit an ad, it takes me to the play store or website of the ad. This game needs some fixes but other than that, it's pretty good.",
            "Enter Coupon in temu profile section to get $100. It's top on affordable items online store to access, but it's really chintzy with coin payouts. It gets very \"expensive\" to play each round and even when you win, you don't always recoup the base cost (you never recoup the costs if you choose to \"buy\" extras). I appreciate that they want people to spend real money, but clearing a level should at least consistently get your \"buy in\" back. You just hit a point where each round costs too many coins.",
            "Enter Coupon in temu profile for $100. The temu is ok. It gets smooth as you use. They give offers so I would recommend saving those. My issue is the side apps from the main game. You will never beat it or get anywhere near close to finishing it because of the insane amount of energy you need to clear the land to complete the task. The same with the merge games. The overly redundant times you need to merge the items to get what you need is insane. You can just do it for fun, never completion.",
            "It is a decent site. The deliveries are fast and most of the time the packages arrive undamaged. HOWEVER, the app is awful. Every page has a spinning wheel and takes up so much time I get frustrated, close the app and go over to Aliexpress. STOP wasting our time. We are already on your app, stop slowing people down from shopping. If you just quit trying to force a discount on us and just give the discount, people would get more stuff. Just stop."

            "app is still a bit difficult to navigate, I was attempting to make a purchase on the app. I had items in my cart for purchase. So then I apparently opened up Walmart online through my browser. I was switching back and forth from the app and the site and had two different cart contents. I almost paid for the wrong cart, glad I didn't but still, there should be a way to link your accounts, through the app and the site as long as you are signed in to your profile... Just saying",
            "The Wal-Mart app is good for the most part, but one bug that I found is when I try to select substitutions. When I search for a similar item it kicks me out of the substitute section, and I have to start over. I noticed it does that even after I hit the select button for a substitution. I had to select the done button after each item or it wouldn't save. Also, when selecting substitutions, it doesn't show all available options for a product that I just saw when I was adding items to my cart.",
            "I always compare prices from Amazon and Walmart. Walmart is becoming more and more competitive every time. If the prices are the same, I ALWAYS purchase from Walmart because I hate Amazon and would love to never use it again. The cost savings of using it almost make life without it impossible due to limited income. Walmart's app is becoming easier and easier to use and had very nice features, like add multiple to the cart with a single tap. Keep it up Walmart!",
            "Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! This is the second month in a row the app has glitched out this time costing me $188.31. It goes to blank screen and you think that the oder wasn't placed; it doesn't show up in your shopping cart. So When I added it to another order it show up in the original order. Canceled immediately and they shipped it anyway even though their representative said it was taken care of. Ended up with two of the same order.",
            "I value the app. Some functions are lacking. The sort by price only somewhat sorts so I feel I need to check the entire list to make sure I am getting the lowest price. The pricing also bizarre. You will have an item priced for $15 and the exact same item listed for $35 with neither item on sale. I can't seem to easily move saved favorites to different lists and recently the option to select alternatives at checkout isn't available. Thank you"

            "The whole experience of using the app if fine and much better than the web interface. Coin collection is a nice feature. Search customizations are not adequate and too many things to click on. Sometimes not enough spec on the product while they are available on other platforms. The app should be streamlined in a better way. One thing I hated the most is the ad or notification that pop up when you open the app. Over all, would you use it again and continue purchasing from Ali Express.",
            "Everything I have ordered has came as described. Be careful of pricing, some things are showing photos of larger items with low prices. For example: Click on a large tent that is listed as $12 dollars and find out that is the price for the tent stakes ONLY. THEN once you have been drawn in the price of the actual TENT will be .....say...$260. If your looking for cheaper options for some items this would be my go to app. I have ordered over a dozen items. Shipping could take weeks.",
            "Our experience is merchant after merchant...that fails to deliver. They use various tactics to lying about shipping info, reroute shipments, screw up tracking numbers, report after a week they don't have inventory, and more. Illegal listings, where they show a main image, describe it accurately in the title, and show a price. BUT go into listing to buy or put in cart and they suddenly show other items to pick from, where the other items are the price listed and jack up the price on main item.",
            "Mobile app is easier to use than the desktop version, because the site opens a window for every product you view, which makes it difficult to navigate. As for the shop, I've purchased several items, and shipping can vary from early, on time and late. I've select products from seller's that have detailed product information as well as plenty of details about the company.",
            "App is just the website: usually misleading, different prices than the item shown. Items not packed, just thrown in a baggie, so most items arrive damaged. That is, if it arrives at all. Ali requires proof that an item was not delivered. After many attempts, they asked I provide a letter on official stationary from the carrier. Local tracking only refers you to the Chinese sender which has no customer service access. So even though items are cheap, you don't always get what you paid for."

            "There's no way in the app reasonably to leave feedback. Amazon is very hard to contact. The app does not sort products by price or any other reasonable way that one would normally sort lists of things. You can select things by price range or by company but I just want to sort things from cheapest to most expensive and that is not an option in Amazon shopping that I can find.",
            "I used to enjoy the app, had no issues, and used it often. I liked the app much better than their website, but now the app is unusable. It freezes/crashes every single time. If I go to look at product pictures or reviews, guaranteed freeze. If you can't look at items to purchase, check reviews, or browse more than 2 minutes, the app is pretty much useless.",
            "I use it all the time, I generally like it, and i built amazon into my routines, I have to give this review because they do not bill the default card on my account. they bill what appears to be the newest card on the list. This has resulted in much heart ache because the cards were there for very specific classes of purchases, I have to keep stuff separate. this results in extra fees and pain. I've called and chatted, no fix. will go back to 4 star likely when fixed. because it takes so long",
            "This app takes forever to load and change screens. It pushes subscriptions too much. Impossible to re-find a product. It is great for the people who want groceries delivered and/or use the subscription option. Plan on jumping through 3 or more hoops if you need to contact them. But they have free shipping most of the time.",
            "They never follow delivery instructions. Your card gets charged at random times and not right away after placing an order. I've had Amazon take money out for orders weeks after I got them because they never charged me for them. Prime video is a mess. It's $3 extra a month to watch without ads and that's a limited selection. You need multiple subscriptions and to purchase shows and movies. If you order any food / drinks and it gets damaged, you won't get a replacement."

            "Very bad and invasive app. I just wanted to search for a product on the website and it kept pushing me to the app like 30 times in 5 minutes. When I finally gave up and installed it, it kept trying to make me sign up and take my information before I even could look at anything. In the end it was buggy and images were overlapping, etc. Just not worthy - Alibaba will never be even close to A****n! Uninstalled.",
            "The items are great, but when I click on one of the variation options and add enough that I more than satisfy the minimum requirement, then press the \"Send inquiry\" button. it just shows a black screen and I have to can't send an inquiry after adding over the minimum quantity. I can get back via phones back button, but can't buy anything. Please assist. I'm on a Pixel 7 Pro running Android 14. Thanks!",
            "Search option is pretty bad because it doesn't understand what you're typing. But really, it spammed me with pop-ups and kept freezing the app with a notification that I needed to close the app to update it. I checked the store and it's updated so it's a bug. Can't find anything that is related to what I typed + freezes every 15 seconds (I'm not joking)= uninstall.",
            "You'll be amazed. . The variety of products, the crazy prices, the well executed seller (often factory) sites, it all makes for great window shopping if nothing else. And you don't have to buy bulk on everything any more to get a great price either. Shipping is still the catch. But if you are willing to wait or can spread the shipping with quantity.. Have fun",
            "It's just a little hard finding things you want. What I may think it will be and what they will have interpreted to say for sale are two different things App works very smoothly. No problems with it on my droid phone and it updates just fine. Installed 3 different phones & office computer. On my phone for over a year. Makes researching new products and styles very easy. Cuts out the middleman. Too much to look at. LOL"

            "The Target app is my go-to for convenient shopping on-the-go. It's user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation make browsing and purchasing a breeze. The Target Circle rewards program offers great discounts and savings. However, occasional glitches and slow loading times can be frustrating. Improvements in app stability and performance would elevate the user experience. Despite these issues, it remains an essential tool for managing my shopping needs.",
            "Search feature is absolutely broken. It doesn't give you what you are searching for half the time, and when it does, the first half of the results are usually unrelated garbage. The filters don't work, and it will show you what you filtered out anyways. It won't show you search results often times if you aren't specific enough. For example I searched for t shirts, and was told no results found. I searched for mens t shirts, and it suddenly found 800 results.",
            "Would do 0 stars but not an option. App itself is great for finding items in store, but god forbid you try to order anything for delivery. Twice I've tried and had original orders canceled and replaced with iPad. Both times I've had to call both Target and shipt telling them I never authorized replacement or purchase of iPad. Oh and the hours of phone time where it's not Targets fault that I got charged for an item I didn't authorize because shipt driver can decide to change order and charge me.",
            "Update: Okay, now I can't even select a store or enter a zip code without an error. Jrjfjfkfkf. The app was great but has increasingly gotten worse with each new update. I rely heavily on this app daily. Yesterday, I took it to the store and had to force close the app every single time I scanned an item, just because it would freeze up. The bugs have significantly increased how long I'm at the store. It's frustrating to use now, unfortunately, and the app is primarily how I used to shop.",
            "Very useful and feature rich app, but lacks notifications channel. Android has this beautiful feature to set different notifications preferences for different types of notifications from same app. I'd want my \"ready for pickup\" notification to be loud whereas deals & offers in silent and can catch up later. But Target app doesn't provide this capability."

That way, you&#39;ll never miss a new item or a flash sale from that small shop you&#39;re low-key obsessing over. You know the one – that great seller who answers every question with a smile. And, they always write a sweet note for you to find when you open your beautifully wrapped order. Take care and talk soon, friend!",
        "comments": [
            "The fact that there is not a way to download digital purchases from the app is absolutely ridiculous. The app interface is okay, though there are plenty of rough spots. Finding a full list of things you've saved can be tricky and annoying. Navigating through a sellers catalog is also tedious, but it could be worse. Esthetically, the app is lovely. I just wish it were backed up by better functionality.",
            "I used to love this app, but now it won't even let me log in on the phone app or on my computer. I just keep getting an error message stating \"too many requests\". I've cleared the cache and storage in the app, I've restarted my phone, and even uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but it still doesn't work. It's very frustrating!",
            "You know very well there isn't a method to contact support for app issues on your site. This isn't about my account, this is about the way your app is developed. There are certain push notifications I do and don't want, but I don't have the option to choose - trying to toggle any one type of notification takes you to Android OS' notification settings for the app, forcing you into an all or nothing agreement. Either you accept their ads and annoying useless messages, or you get no updates at all.",
            "Trustworthy company with many protections for the consumer. I am never worried about purchasing from Etsy, and I think it is a great way to support small businesses from all across the world! However, the recent updates to the mobile update makes it confusing to navigate. I preferred when there was a separate tab for my favorites, and it just showed me my lists instead of a continuous \"there's only one left of this item!\" I think a whole tab just for gift cards is wholly unnecessary.",
            "I used to love shopping on Etsy. Browsing for hours through all of the wonderful goodies. But the app and site have become so messy that it's too overwhelming to use. They have made literally everything a big image which is overstimulating and nowhere is there a place to change the view to a simple list or even smaller images. There's way too much going on and to contact them it's pretty impossible. I won't be using Etsy anymore until they clean it up."

            "The eBay app is a good alternative to the desktop/laptop version, in a few ways. For one, there are notifications and special coupons for using it. Also, the essential categories and settings in the site are prioritized for mobile devices. Also, there is less RAM used than a desktop/laptop, which helps maintain the bare minimum for an online application.",
            "I don't think I've had a bad experience with buying on ebay. I only wish i used this site for all my sales. Other than that, even with returns for something that came wrong, different than pictures, broken, or I changed my mind, I've never had an issue with any seller. Nor needed ebay's help to back me up on a return. Sellers have all been great, happy buyer, soon to be seller.",
            "Great app: needs improvements. 1. There seems to be a bug with item listing from saved sellers store's which are out of stock showing up as if they were not yet sold out. 2. I think more customization options added to seller profile pages such as status message separate to that of the seller's bio. It's gets annoying over time a when trying to track specific items from saved sellers stores, there's limited native options for, third party websites pick up where eBay saved searches lacks.",
            "Love eBay!! If you want something that is usually expensive, check eBay before buying it, cuz 99% of the time it's there & it's cheaper! Things are available Brand New, Open Box, Used or bid on an item it's up to you. Who doesn't like to save money?!? I know I do! I also sell items on there & you can too, it's pretty easy. You can just scan the bar code & everything about it pops up, or u can enter the info. You can even see what the going rate is! I'm telling you, check out eBay it's worth it.",
            "Absolutely awful no matter what I do gift card, debit, credit, PayPal, etc. They will not accept any money at all. I've contacted them and they totally brushed me off, told me to wait 24 hours and ended the conversation. Now they say it's my bank contacted the bank nope they say that ebay is ending the transaction and issuing a refund. DO NOT AUCTION ON THIS SITE. once upon a time it was good but not anymore!"

            "I'll give 5 stars since I've been a loyal user making lots of profit through this awesome app. There is just one major thing that I'd want offerup to add and that is the feature to cancel shipments and offers instead of having to wait days for it to automatically expire. That is by far the only thing I'd love for you guys to fix other than that this is the best place to form a selling business!",
            "The app is good however it's frustrating when you're looking for something and it's been posted years ago, not sure if you have any control of removing things that are old but would be nice if there was a sort option for newly posted. Update: Shows old postings that are no longer available shows postings from about 6 years ago and postings not even within the miles I've set",
            "Their website needs some work. Messaging and browsing is great. However, it would be much easier if we can post or edit listings from there. Especially since the app can be so laggy and slow. I'd also like to have the ability to send pictures via messages. Sometimes buyers would like to see more pictures of the item. Or something specific about the item. The only options are to post more pictures, which require to edit the entire listing, or take the conversation off the app.",
            "I really do like OfferUp. I've sold and bought quite a bit from here. My complaint is that every single time I open the app, I have to click *Local so I don't see the items that can be shipped. I have to do this EVERY TIME! iIt's annoying because the items that can be shipped take up the space of items that are local that I'm looking for.. Also, if I look up an item, let's say RVs, it will then display RVs for all eternity. Even though I no longer am ínter in them. That's annoying as well.",
            "I like that there is a reputation system unlike Craigslist, it helps weed out the flakes and lowballers a little. Prices are not displayed on search result thumbnails like Craigslist has, however. You have to go into each item individually to see the price. A lot of ads in search results, often not even relevant. Search results require a lot of sorting. I bought something from a seller who shipped the item and I have no way of rating them! No way to just block someone you have to report them too"

Seems like this happens about once a month and then an update comes out and it works for a few weeks and then it's back to not opening again. Menards app just always works and opens quickly. Lowes, you need to get this resolved once and for all.",
            "I never write app reviews. Making an exception for this. App has been broken for a week or two now. Search works maybe 1 out of 10 times. Eventually it thinks it has no network connection and stops working completely. The latest update has not fixed the issue. Really disappointing that a huge company like Lowe's has let such a major bug fester in production for so long.",
            "This app is trash. Constantly loses connection or freezes. Links from email auto open in the app, but the app never loads the link you click on and just shows a spinning circle. Filters reset constantly when searching for items in the app. Previous purchases are hard to search and sometimes items are missing/incomplete. Better to stick to just using the web.",
            "UPDATED: I updated to the new version this morning, I checked for a new version last night before I wrote the original review. Thanks so much for the quick response and fix! It's back to working! (original post) >The last update was awful. Can't do a search at all... Just glitches with the blue circle. I used the app a few days before the update and it was great. Now I have to go to the web version just to do a search.",
            "Recent update has made this app useless. It says it can't find an internet connect. I've halted the app, cleared the cache, updated it and it's still stuck. When I try to do a search, it refuses to let me type and tries to force in search suggests of its own. It makes it COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to use!! Fix this thing or I'll be doing all my shopping at Home Depot,"

            "I used to love this app. Now, it's mostly useless to me (I use Route instead). I went to check it today, and at least 10 non-Amazon orders that were all delivered over a week ago were still marked as in transit! Even with packages that are still in transit, it shows days behind the tracking on the carrier's site and my other tracking app. Plus, Amazon NEVER works! Every time I open the app, I have to reconnect Amazon. Even after reconnecting, the orders still won't load properly or at all.",
            "This app has great connectivity to all of my orders confirmed through email, as well as amazon. It's nice to have all the info in a centralized place. HOWEVER, the \"Shop Cash\" you earn while using the app has very short expiration and I've lost out on too many of the benefits in just the last year or so I've been using this app. Rakuten is definitely my preferred app over this because it's far less stressful to use and there are no deadlines on utilizing the benefits. Hope this changes!",
            "The app works much better lately, however, I've been having trouble with something. Sometimes one of my orders will ship in 2 shipments, with one being delivered before the other, marking the entire order as delivered in my list. I try to manually track the second order, but it says I'm already tracking it. I recently figured out where to see both tracking numbers, however, there is no way to mark the order as only partially delivered. It's so complicated to track the 2nd shipment.",
            "It was very organized and helpful. Now my payment plans don't show up. I don't like that there is not a specific spot for them anymore. There are literally no recent dates when I make purchases for payment plans, or when I pay it off. It makes me not want to use it for payment plans anymore. Just shipping updates Update: emailed customer service, other than telling me how to use the app. The way to fix the updates is to click the link myself from my email. This doesn't fix the problem w/the app",
            "App is fine except for one thing. The number one thing about the app is when a package is going to be delivered, the picture goes from the product you ordered to a package and won't tell you what it who the seller is and becomes a pain when you have multiple packages and you get notified something was delivered but you don't know what. The notifications are super delayed, so it makes keeping track harder than need be. Just don't change the image, and that fix it"

I'm probably not alone in thinking that I'd pay a little more for the sip & save if that's what it would take to keep it alive, as I'm assuming it was ended due to it's inprofitibility. I enjoy the games to (hopefully)win instant prizes & CS is always on point in my store.",

And then it only works right after I go through the process and re-enter my phone number. Once I close the app and then try to go back in, the same thing happens. Please fix the bug that is causing this. Then I will change my rating.",
            "I updated this app 12/21/23, right after I reveived a text about the sweepstakes. There is no way to enter in the app... the linked pictures don't work... what seems like there should be a text link does not work. Not the first time I have had trouble; in the past I have had trouble getting coupons... it shows local stores and goes to a map when you click on yours and you can go no further. Had to go to website to enter sweepstakes. Staff at my store could not make sense of, or help with, app.",
            "Great in theory....except nothing EVER rings up with the discount or coupon by just entering your phone number or scanning the app. By the time I've convinced the cashier of the price its supposed to be by scrolling thru the app, they are good and irritated, along with everyone in line behind me. I am hopeful you will work out the Inner Kinks.",
            "It's nice to win prizes, discounts on gas, treats, & beverages, won lots. As for the ticket entries nothing has ever come of those, @least for me & I've won many. 1st part of game is fun-you win prizes. 2nd is inaccurately scored so it's frustrating when you select appropriate items in a row & they aren't counted properly! It makes the game pointless & no longer a challenge if it's not going to be documented.Therefore, a waste of my time! Loved easy pay,but took calling multiple x to get set up!"

        "comments": [
            "I have been using fetch for over a year now. It was great for a good while, but then deals on receipts weren't being registered. I have to manually add them, except, I never receive the points for those items. Correcting the receipt doesnt actually do anything. I definitely miss the wheel. The games feature takes too long to earn points and installing apps is a hassle, for very little in return. I like being able to just snap a receipt, spon the wheel, get my points and get on with my day. Thx.",
            "It's free money if you were going to buy the items anyway. I preferred when there was a spin feature after each receipt capture. You can get more points playing the games, but I personally am not invested enough to spend more than 10 extra seconds in the app. If you are invested, the games are the way to go. I've gotten $30 in rewards so far by doing absolutely no work except snapping a photo of my receipt. It's so easy.",
            "I like the idea of being able to get gift cards for scanning receipts but they keep going up on how many points it takes to actually get a gift card. That is added to the fact that fetch has a \"spend\" threshold in order to get the extra points that used to be available for buying one or 2 products. I rarely get more than 25 points per receipt anymore. And the games thing added? I have to change my phone settings to play that \"personalizes\" ads. Its a no for me",
            "I love this app. Only thing I've noticed lately is my deal points don't auto register. I have to contact support for them to correct the receipt. Which is effect; I just don't care to always have to contact them to have it corrected. I've also noticed that it doesnt pick up on my reciepts for my Gmail. If you'd have asked me three years ago how I liked this app; I'd have given it 5 stars. But, recently its gone down hill. I hope they fix the bugs",
            "Nice app. Appreciate that this was created. As a software BA, my enhancement suggestions would be: 1. Improve recognition of gas receipts. Tried more than several times to get the app to accept it, and then still had to enter the total manually. (i.e., BJs) 2. When user selects a picture to view the promo item, it is helpful that user sees a slightly zoomed-in image but allow further zoom-in to see the words on the label. There are many products we are not familiar with. (Some of us are older.)"

            "The app hasn't worked well for almost 2 weeks. Products will not load when clicking on recently viewed items or special buys. I can add items to the cart and the number of items on the cart icon rises, but it will not load and instead gives an error screen. I experience no issues visiting the website through the Chrome app. I have cleared cache, app storage, forced stop, uninstalled, and reinstalled...This isn't new, the app often experiences failure & bugs.",
            "I have never been able to log into my account. All I get is a spinning circle, I've tried turning off my Wi-Fi, turning off my VPN, pretty much everything. I download it every once in awhile. hoping there's been an update that fixes this issue, but to no avail. Without being able to log in, I might as well use my phone's web app since it works better. This app has no value or efficient usage. I'd give this zero stars if I could.",
            "Getting to your account & credit card information is wonky at best. I always end up having to use the internet citi bank site to get to the last payment & statements information page. The app is best mainly for making an order or searching for products and even then, the discounts shown aren't always calculated the same as in the store, nor are the prices.",
            "Great place for most of your needs. Friendly staff, always willing to help! But the app sucks... no way to filter for instore items...you have to click on an item to check to see if they have it in store or you have to order it. It would also be great if you could see similar compatible parts if the part you want is not available. I had to change my rating due to frustration 🫤.",
            "Valuable, but imperfect. I use this app every day so I'm a heavy user of it. The biggest issue right now is that often the in-store location (aisle, bay) doesn't show up when it's supposed to. This is frustrating. Also, the price often doesn't show up. It's the space below the product image and above the pickup/delivery option that often fails to display. Otherwise, it's incredibly useful to make a shopping list, access reviews, check order status, check in stock status, etc."

            "It's ok.When I click on an ad and it takes me to the app the actual item from the ad is nowhere to be found.I do like the membership and ease of browsing but their usually out of my size and most of the styles I look up.Also, the outfits on the models/the outfit match up with the shoes could be much better for outfit ideas...Other than that the buying and shipping processes are good.I once bought shoes that were too small and the return process was easy.I also enjoy the customization tool.",
            "It's pretty good it does have it problem when I add items onto the cart and take the items off. It somehow glitches and freezes, so I can not make a transaction. I once had to log out and blog back into my account to make a purchase. I do wish it would let me know if and only when I bought an item and they run out of stock that they let me know before my transaction goes through. Although it's been a long while since that happened, Nike may have fixed this problem.",
            "This app (as with many apps), likes to reformat....often. Those of us that are \"older\" 😬😄 PREFER an easier, streamlined online experience. Sure, the \"old look\" might be \"boring\", but there's an ease-of-use in simplistic terms. I don't like navigating through some site, to try and figure it out. If it gets too confusing, I'm out. No shopping at that point. But it's been mostly alright, so far. I usually only look at running shoes, and maybe occasionally browse.",
            "Overall it's great. You can easily navigate through the app. The only thing they should fix is when you change some of the specific preferences, like changing to only show shoes in a specific size, if you then swipe left from all to Jordan or anything else, then back to all it will reset your preferences so you then have to go back and select specifics again. This can get pretty annoying especially if you swipe left by accident and then have to reset everything and rescroll to where you were.",
            "The scrolling gesture will a lot of times will cause the app to swipe to the right moving to a different category especially when scrolling with your thumb one handed. This wouldn't be too big of an issue if the app kept any filters you had applied active when swiping from one clothing category to the next. Unfortunately it resets filters and sends you all the way back to the top. Pretty frustrating at times especially if you managed to get way down the list."

            "The app is very helpful. I probably look at it once or twice a week. I love the ability to have ordered delivery, order drop off, or pick up options. I like being able to choose a store/location. We probably have been in 8 different stores in 8 year. We love to check out the Sam's club near wherever we may travel. The app location helps us see what is available at that store. I enjoy scan and go too.",
            "I've done pickup orders a number of times and have never had any issues. The entire app worked great until today, when I was unable to \"check-in\" at the store. The \"I'm here\" function would only take me to a blank screen. This was before store opening, so I had to flag down an associate who was bringing out another order - about a 20 minute wait. Now, I'm hesitant to use pickups in the future.",
            "As of the last few months, the ability to use the EBT PIN pad on Scan and Go while in-club fails. I am able to \"slide to pay\" at check out, but when the PIN pad attempts to load, it produces an error message suggesting to update the app. I have updated the app many times, but it still fails. Uninstalling, reinstalling, restaring my phone has all produced no results. Months ago, the PIN pad loaded just fine. For reference, I have a Samsung Galaxy A53 5G. Android OS, of course.",
            "I downloaded the app thinking it would help organize my life and make things simpler but that is a joke. Even when I have the location turned on, it won't allow me to set my club store, the app constantly crashes, nor does it all me to add things to a list that I created. It's simply the worst. Guess I will only be using it as a reminder for when my membership is due for renewal!",
            "Generally love the app, scan and go is very convenient, HOWEVER, rating 2 stars to express my dissatisfaction with the local club delivery service through the app. It is \"batch order processing\" which translates to \"you will never receive the order when you scheduled to receive it and you will not get an updated time of when to expect it.\" Don't offer a service you can't stick to."

            "The app makes it easier to use Affirm at checkout and makes it very easy to make payments on the loans I have with them. The detail section of your purchases and agreements are easily understood with their visual breakdown they give you on the manage page. I'm not one to jump on loans either so this is not a quick sent review. I applied to see if I would have any ability to use them and once I did, I didn't even purchase anything for a few months and then started with something real small.",
            "Best savings app ever!!!! I've been using this free app for over a year. I like that I can schedule automatic deposits into it for however much I want. Their interest APY is insanely good so I'm now receiving more than $10/month just in interest on my own money. As my balance gets larger, so does the interest I'm making. I just set 2 automatic deposits per month and forget about it. Its a wonderful way to build up an emergency fund without feeling stretched with your normal paycheck!",
            "I've been using this for maybe 8 months. No problems with my payments (except for a late payment due to affirms error) They'd even recently raised my limit. Then I paid off two loans early and suddenly I'm not approved to use the service anymore for any amount. I really don't understand and since I use for emergency purchases it's really inconvenient. No one seems to be able to help me figure it out.",
            "I absolutely love the app. I love affirm, period. How cool is it that you can select your loan payments and they will let you switch the due date. It's pretty awesome when you can split the payments instead of paying for it all at once. This is pretty awesome. I even received the affirm credit card. It's absolutely one of my most fav one of credit cards. Usually it's interesting free. I do love this app. I set up auto pay and I never have the be bothered with payments or late payment. Awesome",
            "Been making payments ahead of time, for some reason affirm returns funds back to my bank, i have to make payment again and by that time it says late payment. I called customer service several times and they aren't helpful at all, they have no answer as to why its happening and won't fix it and all this goes to my credit report. Overall every purchase goes smooth. But unfortunately just gonna pay what I owe and close account."

When you go back tk the app it refreshes to the main page and you lose your search results and your place. Filtering is also very hit or miss. What's the point of an app if it's less useful than the website?",
            "The app was always buggy, but overnight there was a major update, and now the app is useless. I have items in my cart from yesterday, but am unable to checkout bc it just keeps spinning and won't load. Same with search. I'm going to uninstall and use my desktop. Also, there has never been a way to find out if an item is in stock at a specific warehouse, and that's the thing we all need.",
            "Love the app but please add a scan & go option like Sam's, and I'd love it even better! 😊 Also, it's annoying that when I look at an item & go back, it doesn't return me to my search results, it takes me all the way back to the beginning & I have to search again. Fix that please.",
            "I believe they made the app purposefully terrible to use to get you into the warehouse. Costco app and website are horrible. Difficult to use. Frequent errors adding items to cart. Out of stock items continually show and you get to cart before it complains with some weird error. I just give up on ordering about half the time. The app resets to home page when your phone screen locks. What a disaster",
            "I don't much understand the purpose of this app if it doesn't allow you to search for products that are in store? Searching for products only shows results that can be delivered, so it's essentially useless for anything that's not an appliance. Like I'm not even asking for it to show me where an item is in the store, I just want to know says your system says you have it. It's just an odd choice. Also please stop the screen from going to maximum brightness when tapping the account button. Pleas"

            "Easy & saves a lot. My only issue is sometimes items won't ring up the same price as on the app. & employees won't always change it to match. Also, different prices & deals for each store. Even in the same town. So you have to change the app store location to know what deals you get. When everything is what it says, runs smoothly, then it's a great way to save.",
            "It is a difficult app to use. It can't switch from in-store shopping without having to go through a couple of steps. it's hard to shop at home to make a list because my store doesn't allow pick up, so it shows the stuff is added to my list but all the totals are zero so I can't get a total. I go to check out it doesn't always load the coupons in the register when I put my phone number",
            "Fix your app! It's always messed up. Gives error message when scanning items -if u can even get that far and since update its a pain to get to my list - which I also had to erase and restart due to glitches. Always freezes up or after scanning a few things will no longer scan and just go back to main screen or will say everything is 0.00 til you close then reopen app then it works for about 2 minutes and starts messing up again.",
            "Sad to say, it's the only app for DG. The app shows wrong prices, not all items listed, either with price, or even a picture, or not even listed at all. The cart calculator is NOTHING but a hot mess for employees! This causes issues in stores. Coupons don't always work, or are not even available for use when they should be. The app needs to be updated with a major overhaul to make it actually work correctly. In short, this app is a joke to Dollar General.",
            "Good Idea, Failed Execution The ability to search for and add coupons and cash back to an app / program tied to your phone number is easy, convenient, and nowadays fairly standard. DG makes it easy to do that in their app. What it *cannot* do, apparently, is actually retrieve that information and honor the coupons and cash back at the store. The manager and I even went through every item that was supposed to be discounted, and she agreed that they were all legit. It just doesn't work."

            "For me, this app has been a great help! Whether scanning QR codes or UPC barcodes, I've had no issues with reading them, or reading them accurately would be a better way of describing the experience that I've had with the app. It really speeds the process of item listing in online auction sites as well.......",
            "Works great. Just as long as you know the difference between the link and the advertisements. It is a bit deceptive. The app has a large green open button, clicking on that open button takes you to the add. The actual link that has been scanned is at the top of the screen. It is deceptive in that manner. If you are aware of it, you won't have any trouble with it. For a free QR and Barcode scanner it preforms exactly as it should. I can deal with add's for a quality app. Good job",
            "Works great. I haven't tried every code scanner. But I tried a lot that were nothing but problems. This one does as discribed. Ads are on the bottom of the screen and don't adversely affect your ability to scan barcodes, and look at information on the internet about the item scanned. It works, as discribed. The app developer should get props for a integrity and not wasting my time. I found no \" new problems, or strange phone behavior\" no abuse of my data. I am definitely going for the upgrade.",
            "Works as expected, though ads are not vetted for deceptive practice. Most ads have a big call-to-action button beneath them, either \"Open\" or \"Install\". This button is not an obvious part of the ad and schemed to look like a functional part of the app. When showing the \"Open\" button, it is entirely too easy to confuse with a button that would open the link decoded from the barcode. Although the ad is labeled as such, it needs to be visually framed. Until that happens, this app is deceptive.",
            "Similar complaint as other users have said. When I scanned a QR, it brought up two links. One link with a big blue button that was actually an ad. The other link which was the one I wanted, was much more inconspicuous. I was in a rush trying to pay for parking. I accidentally opened the ad link thinking it was to pay for parking. I foolishly filled out the form and entered my credit card info. Now, my bank account has been hacked because the link is a scam site. 1 star for hosting a scam."

            "Liking the new app. It's working great on my Pixel 7 Pro. The app runs faster, is less glitchy and doesn't time out. I like how the new split screen lets you sit across from each other and read the text. I use this to translate Thai, which is a notoriously difficult language. The app isn't perfect but does much better giving an accurate translation. It would be nice to be able to save larger transcripts than currently able to now.",
            "I am extremely disappointed in this app. It has been working fine for years.... and now all of a sudden it says there's no connection and it will not work. I have tried all the troubleshooting things available out there including the links noted below but the problem persists. Clearly there is an issue with the app and needs to be updated given all the negative reviews recently I hope you guys can fix this quickly because I rely on this app daily. PLEASE READ MY FULL REVIEW! ALREADY DID ALL THAT",
            "Great app. It is fairly accurate for the most part. Occasionally, I do verify the translation through another source. The live camera portion still needs some work to be useful. My favorite feature is having the translate icon show up when I copy a word. This makes translations even faster. I did not give it more stars because there is still room for improvement.",
            "See, I use this to translate for elderly people that can't see, and I wanted the ability to flip my phone sideways to show them the translated word and it would show the translation at a full screen. They can't see 20 point font, the word has to literally be 72 point font! So bring back the full screen experience! NOW!",
            "Was five stars, now zero. I work at a hotel with many Latino employees and this had been the best translator app out there. Then one day I open it up and it won't function at all. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, restarted my phone, nada. I have a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, and I hope they fix it because it was easily the best one with the best features, because I've tried them all. It's your update, Google, not our phones, not how we're using it. Totally nonfunctional. Fix it!"

            "I purchased a new Samsung device for the holidays. My previous tablet had zero problems transferring my data. Unfortunately, that is NOT the case this time. I follow all the prompts, but for some reason, the wireless transfer gets to 5.4% before saying the connection is lost. I have tried numerous times with no success. HOW does the connection keep getting dropped when the devices are literally right next to each other?! Samsung has been losing cool points lately!",
            "Seems to copy almost all apps and data. CAUTION- Turn WiFi to DHCP on the old phone because it over-writes your WiFi settings on the new phone then disconnects for IP conflict if it's set to static IP. When using a USB-C data cable with a lot of data be sure to have a wireless charger set up! When transferring files is interrupted it doesn't pick up where it was interrupted so you could end up with a lot of duplicate or triplicate files. Sure beats doing it all manually though!!",
            "I don't get all the negative reviews. I used it to transfer data from my old Galaxy phone to the new one and It worked like a charm for me. It did take some time to transfer data but it wasn't more than an hour. I was also transfer pretty heavy size of data. All of my files, device settings and even the app data was transferred without much hassle. Totally loved it!",
            "The App, is as useless, as a Comb is to a Baldmans Head. It only works if you have a higher Android Phone UI, depending on your Model Type; otherwise, it won't work with a much older Cell Phone, with a less UI, let alone, if you don't have wireless, because it does NOT transfer data. Better, to Screenshot or USB, from another source all of your important Passwords, from your Apps, Contacts, etc., to your Phone manually; itwould probably less risk of bringing unnecessary junk to your new Phone.",
            "It does help, but the ads are annoying AND misleading. Some look like part of the app, and someone lacking my keen technical acuity ;) could get confused and screw things up. Ads make it quite cumbersome. Cabled transfer did not work at all. The app is essential, and does work well, but it doesn't have to be this difficult."

No media included in messages came over. Other friends texts stopped at October, November last year. Can't trust what came over and what didn't. Tried updating both phones and resetting iPhone several times, but got the exact same result everytime. If I can't trust it for messages, I won't trust it at all.",
            "DO NOT USE THIS APP!!! After a two hour file transfer, the majority of my messages and apps were gone, contacts merged into groups, thousands of photos are a jumbled mess. It even erased my bookmarks and cleared my favourites on tik tok. Once the “transfer was complete” my Samsung will not turn on or even charge. It’s killed my android phone so I can not recover everything that was lost. DO NOT USE THIS APP.",
            "This app did a decent job transferring data, but it is far from perfect. Group text messages don't really transfer seamlessly. On my new iPhone, my phone number is included in each group as an unknown contact. Google accounts don't actually get transferred, even though \"Google accounts\" is listed as an option to transfer. App data doesn't get transferred at all, which kind of makes sense. Be prepared to setup every individual app after the transfer is complete.",
            "This app is honstly a good way to transfer your android data to your Iphone. Most of what I had on my android moved over without being corrupted. This includes all my messages, phone numbers, apps, and photos. The only bad thing about it is having to wait about 2 hours with your phone on through the whole process. My only other complaint is the duplication of my photos and videos in which I had to go back and manually delete duplicates. Otherwise it is a very useful app if you want to switch.",
            "I am dumbfounded by the negative reviews. I don't know what I would've done without this app as I use my phone for business as well as personal, and my text messages are essential to maintain. I was able to transfer all seamlessly including photos and data. It was completed in less than 15 minutes over Wi-Fi. I was afraid to go back to Apple for the reason of data transfer. This app made it a breeze and I recommend it to anyone making the change. (FYI, Pixel 7 Pro to iPhone 15 Pro Max)."

            "It used to be a useful app, back when it actually worked. However, that has since become a rare occurrence. On the rewards page, although the links work, the text is missing and everything else is so distorted that it is worthless. The same occurs on web pages and news articles. Uninstalling and reinstalling temporarily fixes the issues, but it isn't long before they return (or new ones arise).",
            "This new Verdi of Bing has really hit it out of the park. My new AI assistant Copilot is extremely intuitive, this is the next level of AI, it has been an extraordinary resource and the best that I've found. Trust me, I have experimented with lots of ai and I am constantly disappointed. Copilot is a real game changer and will have set the standard for years to come. And its free!",
            "Super flaky. Crashes constantly. Not only is this app backed by a second rate search engine, but they've shoved their artificial unintelligence agent into every screen at the expense of all other features. News feed is a spammy dumpster fire, and the rest of the app is just a hot mess. Bing, Microsoft News, Office, etc. All have been sacrificed at the alter of Copilot. If only it actually worked. Microsoft is obviously not in the business of writing consumer software anymore. Good luck Satya.",
            "Just using the Nearby feature in the apps section, I hope we get a stand-alone navigation app from Microsoft. Also, it doesn't support Passkey. Please add it. I don't get it, who uses this app when there is Microsoft Edge?? Microsoft makes configurations so often. Also, there is a Start app developed by Microsoft which looks and works exactly like this Bing app.",
            "Pretty flaky overall. Most features either don't work or only work sporadically. I absolutely hate that it creates a separate entry in recent apps for every single tab you open. Bing itself is an app and should only appear once in recent apps list. For some reason it randomly sometimes starts showing me news in the UK... Deals and rewards are all game-ified, but at least half the time you won't get any points for doing what it tells you to. Just don't bother... With the rewards, or the app."

            "Got really tired of things not working correctly. Cloud syncing refused to work. On the rare occasion it actually did sync it would add all the entries from the cloud as duplicate entries. Lacking in a lot of features and it's a pain trying to migrate to a different app. I switched to Aegis Authenticator and it was the best decision I ever made. Took a while to switch my accounts to Aegis thanks to Google not allowing you to export to other apps, but no regrets.",
            "Was fine for over a year then all of a sudden my codes won't work on any website I use it for. I tried syncing but it keeps telling me \"it appears to be synced already.\" I made sure it was updated. I transferred it from one email to another and I was able to log in to one account. Tried logging into the same account again and couldn't do it. Uninstalling and reinstalling fixed it for now but I'm not optimistic.",
            "I've used this app without issue for years. All of a sudden, all of my data was deleted along with all of my backups. I didn't update or reset anything. I tried logging into my Google account, and nothing was there. Now, I can't access a bunch of my accounts, both personal and for work. Also, I can't get ahold of anyone at Google to assist. Even the old backup codes didn't work. Use MS Authenticator instead.",
            "Would love to give this app 5 stars, as it’s a straightforward design that does one thing well.  Almost.  Since earlier this year, the app has not refreshed its list of authentication codes when the 60-second countdown timer rolls over.  Given that many sites don’t have a grace period for codes from the preview 1-2 minutes, this is a stupid UI misdesign or bug (I’m going with the latter).  The lack of a fix makes me wonder if Google hasn’t abandoned this product.",
            "intuitive, consistent, minimal 2FA app with one minor bug great app, allows you to sync to your google account for multi-device or transferring. single point of failure, minor security concerns, but very convenient, so it's worth it. bug: it crashes whenever i try to rearrange my accounts aside from that, no major complaints, very consistent and reliable 2FA app, intuitive, easy to sync/transfer, been using it for ~5 years, no complaints aside from one avoidable crash condition."

            "Works perfectly. Works great for the network I've tested it on so far. It's typically fast but can be slow at times, but I really can't complain since it's free. Though sometimes (not often) can be buggy when you shut it off or can possibly randomly disconnect. When that happens all you have to do it turn disconnect, exit the app, turn off your wifi, turn it back on, and restart the process. Overall I would say it's definitely a great free VPN, even comparable to the paid for VPNs.",
            "This app not really working it freeze a lot and continuously disconnected, I don't know why? maybe because i'm in South Korea? IDK! anyways, Jan 12, 2024 they took the payment for 1 year and Jan. 13 I requested a refund through google play, but google play sent me an email that I need to contact the developer. I already sent an email to the developer and hopefully they give me my money back.",
            "Second worst app of this type I've ran into. Ads Everytime you hit a button. Even when you don't an add pops up every minute or so even when you're watching a vid.",
            "Good concept just that the ads are ridiculously stupid full screen video ads every single time you turn it on turn it off and go from one side to another flush the pop-ups There's no ad blocker and if there is it doesn't work fix this interview good",
            "Video ads are not supposed to be playing on a browser and when i click on the try it for free it says that my password is incorrect even when i type the correct password and why should we pay when it says that it is for free it has to be payment free and thats it and you need to remove ads from this app because i cant afford to buy ads free"

I use this feature even around my house all the time, but it suddenly stopped working. Used to work seamlessly. Samsung 23 Ultra. Device is shown on Google play. Now doesn't work at all. Checked location settings including location history, updates, Find My Device is turned on and every setting as suggested in forums. No fix for this FAIL!",
            "Great concept and but not accurate! I thought I lost my phone and the app showed me where it was last detected. It was a location I had never physically been ever, in the opposite direction of my travel. I figured someone had found it then turned it off. I logged out of my Google account on the device and tried to factory reset it remotely. I found the phone in my recliner at home! Charged it, turned it on and it was in the same condition I left it in - signed into my Google account and all.",
            "3 times the phone's location in complete error. If you have thgis problem once, it may be time to upgrade or troubleshoot. Best approach is to let the phone ring in all familiar possible locations. This it does - but after that it does not give a reliable location - off by as much as 10 miles but within the history of travel. May be certain phone types - as I see others have no problem, others have this exact problem - the wild goose chase effect. Two stars for being free and ringing the phone.",
            "After latest update, all my android devices have vanished from the device list. The screen shows no devices. I have used this for a long time as I am notorious for forgetting where I left my phone. Just opened it up on my tablet and all of my devices were missing. I eventually found my phone, and when I opened Find My Device, it initially listed all the devices, but then wiped out the list and it is now blank as well.",
            "It was working fine all the time just until today this evening. All of a sudden, now my devices are no longer showing or listed. and it's telling me that there are \"No active devices\". Had to clear the storage on install and then reinstall it again just to see if my device's would to will appear on the app. Had to to also go extenxed links by restarting my phone just to find a resolution. Nothing! So if I lose my phone that I'm screwed. What is going on here?"

I think anyone that needs reliable cloud storage should give it a try. It even gives you the option to automatically upload your pictures and videos to help you save time and phone storage space. Thanks TeraBox for an awesome and convenient experience. I would rate 10 stars if it was an option!",
            "If you will not need over 1 terabyte, the app is OK. You can earn extra storage space by playing the silly games for gold to get extra space. Problem is, the extra space you earn is temporary, not permanent. App is loaded down with so many pop ups, they interfere. Features are hit and miss. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. Premium is worth the price, if you want to pay. Upload speed is decent, but downloading a file you have uploaded previous is hit and miss.",
            "They will mislead you with thousands of ads and prompts to buy the premium options, even though you are already a premium user. They want you to think that you did not purchase the premium option for some reason, and they want you to buy their subscription repeatedly. When I contacted them about this, I discovered that I had multiple subscriptions for the same service within the same account. They confirmed the multiple subscriptions and declined my refund request. So they are 100% cheaters",

            "I've gotta rate this app 5 stars. I first installed it on my tablet and seen immediate improvement. Baseball is starting and I was streaming the game on my phone, and I use Verizon, Samsung. The best streaming there is. Never had issues in all the years I've streamed games all season, and all year round, until today. If Verizon samsung starts lagging, you know something is wrong. After having success with this app on my tablet I figured it was worth a shot. Immediate improvement once again.",
            "It's one of those apps that work. Kt doesn't interrupt you in the middle of your phone conversation or some show you may be watching. I like this app because it's simple and fast. It does what is created to do and nothing more or less. And you're phone has added security as well as more space for storage that you need and not the rubbish of duplicate files of junk. Thanks . Q",
            "The ads are worth the service. Cleaned my phone up in 20 min and can track the electric current through the battery monitor in real time. They could make it easier to cancel the ads when the time runs out though, kinda forces ya to see or accidentally click other stuff. So -1 for deceitful ads. Also like the anti virus page ironically having a trojan virus style ad in the result page. Saying Warning! Use it then uninstall",
            "At first I gave it a 5 star. You do have to watch a good amount of ad's. I take it back I've noticed the WiFi network scan and test parts have issues. There's days it has glitches and loads slow. It feels like it takes a while to get through all the parts. It's worth it to me if it works correctly. I really love that it's all in one though.",
            "Fast, reliable, a lot of options to be able to do to clean out your phone. Free. There is an option to buying better if you want to pay for it. I think it's free one works perfectly fine it's fast fast. I think it's a very good app and it should be used by people. I forgot to mention it is also antivirus cleaner too so it cleans your phone and checks for viruses Love it"

            "The app is basically a facelift for your router home page, but it's missing dozens of standard router homepage settings such as hiding your network. Their equipment doesn't let you access the router settings without using the app which means you have limited options if you want to configure your network. Bring your own network equipment if you want a normal router that has full features.",
            "I've complained about this nonsense before, but FIX IT! Ya'll have great tech, but you are SO slow fixing bugs and issues. I have to sign in FROM THE START periodically, even though I check the box TO STAY SIGNED IN! And ANY time I go back into the app I have to put my dumb fingerprint in, even though I was in the app 3 seconds ago! It's the greatest (not) when the sign in completely starts at the beginning! (Not.)",
            "The update has bugs. It's so irritating. Wouldn't even recognize my credentials. Using a browser I had no issues logging in so that narrowed it down to the app. Simple tasks take a long time, forget being able to contact support or doing anything else for that matter, it's not happening. You can pay your bill no problem, which I guess was the priority. Gotta get paid first. If I could rollback I'd do it in a heartbeat. This is how the cookie crumbles and I guess now we wait for the fix.",
            "I love Spectrum and their services. I had AT&T before this and my God was it awful! Spectrum has came out quickly to resolve the issue I had on 2 occasions. They swapped out equipment and ran new wiring to completely eradicate any issues immediately. Other than those 2 times, we have had zero issues. I have multiple services with them because it turns out to be cheaper to have more services.",
            "Updated no longer works. Deleted reinstalled does not work. Tried 3 other devices. Does not work. In all cases will not even open!..... Unavailable often after midnight when I need to use it. Please add Amazon, Hulu, Disney, Paramount Apps in the Appstore. It's very convenient having Netflix and YouTube in the menu. Would be great and actually makes me value my cable when searching on another app that does not have a cable available show!"

Connecting is sometimes very slow, as well. And the ads they push through the notification bar to refer a friend can't be disabled in app. Support told me they would disable them on their end, but apparently they either didn't, or they have since re-enabled them. I'll be keeping an eye out for an alternative. Proton seems promising.",
            "Update: Do yourself a favor and try any other VPN. Very disappointed in Nords service and support. I'm not the only one; it's a very common issue. Constantly disconnects, and takes forever or times out, then won't re-connect. Very often times or when trying to connect to any server. Tried all of Nords suggestions to no avail. Often, when it does connect, throughput is slow, maybe 30% slower than without.",
            "VPN will not connect! Let me be more clear.. when I hit the quick connect button, the button does not respond. It does not do anything. Even if I try connecting directly to a particular city, I get the same reaction. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. I have used NordVPN in the past and haven't had this issue. The only thing I've changed since then and now is I went from an Apple device to a Pixel. Other VPN's do not obfiscate ip on Google pixel when using Google to search.",
            "These guys provide one of the best vpn services out there. They also provide a secure place for passwords and a secure way to transfer small files between devices. the only significant problem I have is when running the vpn 247 all day all night it will either lose connection or disconnect. Which when it does it won't reconnect unless I restart the app pr my phone.",
            "Connection keeps dropping when phone goes to sleep. All settings are set to unrestricted data and battery. EDITED 2/17: Found app blocker in settings to be the culprit. Turn off all blocks. But the key is to restart the phone after making the changes. It won't take effect until a restart occurs. So far no drops in either battery saver or regular modes.

            "Was pleasantly surprised at how many brands and models of TV this works with. I got an old TV secondhand and it didn't come with a remote, now I don't need to buy a replacement right away. Took just a minute to set up and works great. Only issue is that I wish it had more than the bare minimum buttons. (I was really hoping I could use this app to change the display picture size.)",
            "Remote works but ads are annoying. I understand that ads make it possible to get free apps; however, there are times when ads can make an app unusable. Using a remote requires frequent button pushing. It's annoying when a clickable ad pops up just as you are pressing a remote button, and you accidentally open the ad. Seems kinda sneaky in my opinion. I might just write my own app.",
            "Too many ads that bug up using the app. I can't stomach waiting for the app to connect. It did connect but didn't do more than messing with the volume. The ads are always fighting against your ability to learn the app because of the constant need of getting you to click an ad. I'm out!",
            "Connected to my television without any problems, but it could only control the volume. The ads were also very annoying. So I spent $24 to get rid of ads and unlock all the features. It said that it would let me use the touch screen and all of the other buttons. The ads stopped, but I can still only control the volume. I even restarted my phone. Feels like a scam. Update: Apparently it doesn't work with my Brand TV. It should say that somewhere. Still one star.",
            "This app actually works, it has ALL or MOST tv brands, even cable. I downloaded it and it's honestly better than most apps, it has ads every once in a while but there only picture ads, The app is good yes, but I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit slow during times. But other than that if you lost your remote I recommend. Have a great day or night! 💗🥰"

            "Protects my privacy while browsing, and now has an app privacy protection feature that stops apps from sharing my personal information. Well done! It's worked well for me for years. However, recently it's started taking longer to load pages and I'm at times getting messages that the browser can't open a webpage. It's not my wifi as Chrome does not have the same problems. Hopefully this will be fixed in an update soon.",
            "This is by far The Best Browser I have used on my Android device. I no longer get all of those irritating, unwanted ads that cover content and don't have a close button! I would like to be able to use voice searches on this browser that are not on my menu, like Google. I am researching how to resolve this not included feature. So, I must use the Google Voice Search that I Do Not like temporarily, unfortunately. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this browser. It gives me more freedom. No ad wars!",
            "😐 The DuckDuckGo app is: mostly improved lately. [My Favorites bookmarks suddenly disappeared. Multiple detailed reports submitted and AFTER MONTHS, no response. Many web pages just won't work; FEEDBACK REPORTS IGNORED (The app crashes multiple times per day; Audio streams repeatedly stop only seconds after initiating the play/'playback'; It's useless for things such as audio, and others; I've had to return to using other browsers for certain things.)] Beta App Tracker Protection is a big plus.",
            "VPN was easily turned off when I set the option for never disconnect, but this is about the fourth or fifth time, I guess if you don't buy the VPN what can you expect, just a heads up people. And when I sent a message I had to send another before I got a call back at which time some new disclaimer stated that was possible if I was utilizing certain applications , the funny part I was looking at the phone that Was about 2' away and watched it happen, it didn't have anything to do with me!!!",
            "I would give this at 5 stars, except certain tabs just disappear out of nowhere. The back and forward commands don't work appropriately, sometimes when you go back it takes away the option for you to go forward. If you hit back it may even take you to a whole other tab, changing the previous tab creating a situation where you can't find where you just work. Browser history saves nothing, this app was great but it seems kind of buggy now."

            "Way too many adds. I tried to follow the instructions on how to upgrade and couldn't locate. I sent an email and to date, no response. The most annoying thing is the connection issue. I have to unplug the TV each day for the app to connect. After that first time, the connection is fine. It's also annoying that the app times out after non use for a minute. To keep having to connect is ridiculous",
            "About every 3rd tap on the remote you have to contend with an add. It's horrible if you are attempting to search for anything! The remote doesn't stay connected so if you need to pause something after it has sat idle for a bit, best of luck to you. The best feature is when the remote is connected, you can turn the TV both on and off. Honestly, that option and the keyboard are the only features that warrant 2⭐s. Otherwise, the lifetime price of $9.99 would've been an overcharge😭",
            "First of all, there was a purchase price for this app. Now it has ads, and not just at the top, it will expand the ad to full screen while you are using it (every 4th click) so that you will open the advertisement and exit what you were doing. It also won't stay connected to any devices after sitting still for a few moments. I've had this for several months (maybe even a year by now) and I don't like it. This one does have a few extra features over free ones but very frustrating to use.",
            "The only good thing about this is that I'm not having to wait for a new remote to be shipped out. I paid 1069 after taxes for the lifetime access to the app there are now more ads on it then whenever I had the free version that only turned the TV on and off and changed the HDMI settings. You can't even search for a show or open an app without a 30-second ad popping up and stopping you from what you were doing. This was definitely a waste of $10",
            "I would give it five stars. I purchased life time. Cause it was one time pay. Which was great. About 5 days after purchase. You went crazy on ads. When you hit rewind or fast forward here comes ads and it doest stop when you hit skip. By then you went way pass where you wanted it to stop. Slow down ads or I'm gonna cancel."
